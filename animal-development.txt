- Yoke
    - nutrients in ovum for developing embryo
    - Echinoderms (Starfish)
        - Very little yoke
    - Yoke interferes with cell division
        - Lots of yoke in egg can disrupt cleavage
    - Eggs with little yoke
        - Holoblastic cleavage
            - Complete cell division during cleavage
    - Eggs with lots of yoke
        - Meroblastic cleavage
            - Some cells don't undergo complete cell division during cleavage

    - Neurulation
        - Summary
            - Beginning to build a neural system
        * The process by which the nerve cord forms is called “neurulation” and
          involves the folding inward of *ectoderm* along the dorsal surface of
          the embryo.  Thus, even though our brains and spinal chord are inside
          the body, they are actually derived from *ectoderm*.
        * Also involves the formation of the cylindrical notochord from mesoderm
          immediately ventral to the neural tube.  Lateral to the neural tube
          and along its length, spherical clusters of *mesoderm* cells called
          “somites” form symmetrically along the right and left side

            * Not pictured, but
                - Gut is below Notochord
                - Coeloms are to the left and right of notochord
