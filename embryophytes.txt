- Plasmodesmata
    - Interconnections of the cytoplasm of adjacent plant cells that pass
      through pores in the cell wall.  So even though plant cells are surrounded
      in cell walls, they actually form an network of connected cells able to
      communicate and exchange substances with one another.
    - In Summary
        - Tunnels between plant cells for substance exchange and communication
- Stomata
    - Plants need pores and stomata to allow CO2 to diffuse into the plant for
      photosynthesis to occur

    - Liverworts (the most primitive land plants) donâ€™t have stomata. Instead,
      they have pores that are always open and cannot close.

    - All other plants have stomata, which differ from pores in that the stomata
      both open to let in CO2 but also close in order to prevent water loss
      during dry conditions.
