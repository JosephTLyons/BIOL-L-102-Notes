Four Major Macromolecules ("Life Constantly Promotes Normalcy"):
1. Lipids (fats and oils):
    ========================== Building Blocks Below ===========================
    - Monomers:
        1. fatty acids
            - long chains of hydrocarbons + carbonyl group
            - mostly non-polar (hydrophobic), but are considered amphipathic
              because their carbon end is non-polar and their carbonyl end is
              polar
            - Saturated
                - all single bonds linking carbons
                - not kinked
                - "saturated" refers to the Hydrogen atoms.  With all single
                  bonds, we can have more hydrogen atoms (saturated hydrogen)
                - can pack tightly
                - behave like a solid at room temperature
            - Unsaturated
                - have at least one double bond between carbon atoms
                - are kinked
                - pack more loosely
                - behave like a liquid at room temperature
            - trans fats
                - has double bond, but is linear, not kinked
        2. glycerol
    - Steroids
        - hydrocarbon ring structure (hippopotamus)
            - 4 rings
                - 3 6-sided
                - 1 5-sided
    ========================== Building Blocks Above ===========================
    - Polymers
        - Triglycerides
            - 1 glycerol + 3 fatty acid chains
            - fatty acid chains attach to glycerol through dehydration reaction
        - Phospholipids
            - 1 glycerol + 2 fatty acid chains + 1 phosphate group
            - fatty acid chains attach to glycerol through dehydration
            - Phospholipid Bilayer
                - The type of fatty acid affects the permeability of the
                  membrane
                    - saturated = packed, not as permeable
                    - unsaturated = kinks and loosely packed, more permeable
2. Carbohydrates:
    - Monomer: monosaccharide
    - Polymer: polysaccharide

3. Proteins:
    - Monomer: amino acids
        - Know basic shared structure
        - Know 20 different names, polar / non-polar, acidic, or basic
          (amino-acids.txt)
    - Polymer of amino acids = polypeptide
        - The amine group of one amino and the carboxyl group other another
          amino attach to one another through dehydration reaction.  This is a
          polypeptide bond
    - Enzymes: just one type of protein
        - Act as chemical catalysts that speed up reactions that support life
        - Active site = region where other molecules called "substrates" can fit
          in and interact with the surface of the protein
    - The function of a protein depends on its shape
    - The shape of a protein depends upon the sequence of amino acids in its
      polypeptide chains

4. Nucleic Acids:
    - Monomer: nucleotides
    - Polymer: RNA and DNA
