    Terms:
        - Homologous Traits:
            features that are shared among animals because they inherited them
            from a common ancestor

        - Convergent Evolution:
            traits that are similar in structure due to similar selective
            pressures. They are not similar because inherited from a common
            ancestor.

            the process whereby organisms not closely related independently
            evolve similar traits as a result of having to adapt to similar
            environments or ecological niche

        - Adaptive Radiation:
            related organisms that have evolved different traits because of
            differences in their ecology (resulting in experiencing different
            natural selection pressures).
        ========================================================================
        - Axial: bones of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage
        - Appendicular: bones of the upper and lower limbs, shoulder, and hip
        ========================================================================
        - Articulation: a point in which bones make contact
        - Condyles: smooth, rounded bulges, site of articulation
        - Fossae: indented area for articulation, to provide room for muscle
        - Process: bumps or ridges, sites of muscle attachments
        - Foramina: holes for nerves, blood vessels

    - Head:
        - Frontal: forehead region
        - Temporal: above the ear
        - Parietal: upper back of the head
        - Occipital: bottom back of the head
        - Lacrimal: tear duct region
        - Mandible: jaw bone
        - Maxilla: bone upper teeth are attached to

    - Shoulder:
        - Scapula: shoulder bone

    - Arm:
        - Humerus: Upper arm that connects to shoulder socket and ulna
        - Ulna: (wrench) connects to humerus, pairs with the radius
        - Radius: makes up the wrist bone and pairs with the ulna

    - Leg:
        - Femur: leg bone that connects hip to knee
        - Tibia: larger weight-bearing bone that attaches to femur and runs down
                 to the ankle, pairs with the fibula
        - Fibula: smaller bone that pairs with the tibia

    - Hip:
        - Ilium: uppermost largest part of the hip bone
        - Ischium: the curved bone forming the base of each half of the pelvis
        - Pubis: two bones (on the left and right side) that connect to the
                 pubic symphysis (lower center pelvic bone)

    - Mouth:
        - Teeth:
            - Incisors: Snipping (scissor-like) teeth (front row for humans)
            - Canines: Pointer teeth in front left and right (dog-like)
            - Pre-molars: Between canines and molars, look like molars
            - Molars: Very back teeth, used for grinding and mashing

            - Carnassial: molars that are shaped like triangles / incisors for
                          cutting meat (carnivores)

            - Classifications based on types of teeth:
                - Homodont: Teeth are of one type
                    - if all incisors, likely a carnivore
                    - if all molars, likely a herbivore

                - Heterodont: Teeth can be a variety of types
                    - indicates a variety of diets
                    - All mammals are heterodonts; all heterodonts are mammals

        - Diastema: gap in the mouths of herbivores

    - Vertebrae (top-down order)
        - Cervical: neck region
            - Atlas: holds up the head (Atlas "holds the globe")
            - Axis: next bone that allows rotation of the head
        - Thoracic: chest region
        - Lumber: lower back region
        - Sacral: hip area
        - Caudal: bones of the tail (these are fussed in humans and are
                  referred to as the coccyx)

Classification based on diets:
    - Herbivore: Eat plants only
        - Cows, Horses, Mice, Elephants

    - Carnivore: Eat animal flesh or meat
        - Dogs, Cats, Lions, Tigers, Sharks, Snakes

    - Omnivore: Eat both plants and animals
        - Bears, Humans

Muscles
    - Masseter: the masseter muscle helps with the side-to-side motion of the
                mandible when chewing (an asset for a herbivore that has to
                grind its food thoroughly before swallowing).
        - between jaw and head
            - if this is larger and the temporalis is smaller, then it is probably
              a plant-eater, or herbivore)

    - Temporalis: the temporalis muscle provides strength for biting (an asset
                  for a carnivore that has to subdue its prey and slice through
                  flesh).
        - Near the top of the head
            - if this is larger and the masseter is smaller, then it is probably
              a meat-eater, or carnivore

        - Related item: Sagittal crest - ridge running lengthwise along the
          middle top of the skull.  Indicates a very strong bite, as its purpose
          is to connect to the temporalis muscle
