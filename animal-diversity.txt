Animals:
    - Key Common Traits Among All/Most Animals:
        - Eukaryotic
        - Multicellular
        - No Cell Walls
        - Extracellular Matrix (with collagen)
            - Collagen:
                - Protein unique to animals, present in all animals
                - "Glues" things together
        - Heterotrophic (animals generally “engulf” their food)
            - Vs autotrophic
                - Beings that generate their own food
                    - Ex: Like plants do with photosynthesis
        - Movement (typically involving nerves and muscle)
            - Also, cilia and flagella
        - Cleavage (a type of mitosis occurring during very early embryonic
          development)

Background Information:
    -Mitosis vs Meiosis
        - Definition
            - Processes which describe the production of new cells
        - Mitosis
            - Produces 2 daughter cells which are genetically identical to the
              parent cell
            - Each daughter cell is diploid (contains the normal number of
              chromosomes).
            - Mitosis is used in growth and asexual reproduction.
        - Meiosis
            - Produces 4 daughter cells, each of which are unidentical to the
              parent cell and to one another.
            - Each daughter cell is haploid (contains half the number of normal
              chromosomes).
            - There are two cell divisions: the parent cell divides once and
              then each cell produced by this first division divides once.
            - Used to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells), the cells of sexual
              reproduction. Two gametes fuse to form a zygote, a diploid cell
              with the full number of chromosomes.

    - Haploid, Diploid, Triploid ...
        - Definition:
            - Describe the amount of copies of chromosomes in the cell
        - Haploid: 1n
        - Diploid: 2n
            - Most mammals are diploid
                - 23 Chromosome PAIRS (2n = 2 * 23 = 46)
                - The haploid number for humans is 23
        - Triploid: 3n
        - Tetraploid: 4n

    - Gamete
        - A mature haploid male or female germ cell which is able to unite with
          another of the opposite sex in sexual reproduction to form a zygote

Cleavage (what makes it different from other types of mitosis?)
    - Very rapid cell division
    - Synchronized cell division
    - Cells get progressively smaller with each division (i.e., no net increase
      in the size of the embryo)
    - Cleavage is a type of MITOTIC cell division only known to occur in the
      earliest stages of animal development
    * At the end of cleavage, the embryo becomes a "BLASTULA"
        - "Blast-": something that will develop into something else
    * It is after the blastula stage that development begins to vary among
      animal phyla

    - Process
        1) 2 haploid gametes (egg and sperm germ cells) fuse to become a diploid
           zygote.
        2) This zygote begins to rapidly "cleave" until it becomes a blastula
            - Morula: an intermediate stage during cleavage where the embryo
              resembles a “mulberry”
            - The center of of the blastula is called a "blastocoel"
                - "-coel": Having a chamber or cavity
            - The cells here are undifferentiated
            - Will develop into animals with no true tissues, no symmetry, and
              no digestive tract
                -> Porifera stem off here
        3) The blastula undergoes gastrulation and begins to form an
           invagination that becomes a "blastopore" and a "archenteron."  The
           blastula is now called a "gastrula."
            - Blastopore
                - The opening of the now gastrula
            - Archenteron
                - The rudimentary alimentary cavity of an embryo at the gastrula
                  stage.

            - Gastrulation accomplishes two main things:
                1) Establishes an inner and outer layer of cells
                    - i.e. the beginning of tissue differentiation

                2) Establishes the beginnings of a digestive system with an
                   opening called a “blastopore” which will remain the only
                   opening in the digestive system of some phyla, or will become
                   either the mouth or the anus of the digestive system
                   depending on whether the animal is a “protostome” or a
                   “deuterostome”

            - The early stage of gastrulation will go on to form cnidarians
                - Will develop into radially symmetrical animals with only two
                  tissue layers and a digestive tract with only one opening

            - The late stage of gastrulation, the one that include ectoderm and
              endoderm, the archenteron, and the blastopore, will go on to make
              bilateria.
                - Will develop into complex, bilaterally symmetrical animals
                  with three tissue layers, and a complete digestive tract
                  (mouth & anus)
                    * Alimentary canal
                        * Digestive track with 2 openings

NOTE: These are just some notes, as most of this is in practical-1.txt
================================================================================

- Sponge vs Corral Identification:
    - In telling the difference between sponge (porifera) and corral
      (cnidarian), as in quiz 8, look for the specimen to have a cavity / tube.
      If it does, it is more than likely a sponge.

- Cnidocyte vs Nematocyst
    - Cnidocyte:
        - The overall stinging cel structure

    - Nematocyst:
        - Refers to an organelle inside the cnidocyte, consisting of an
          ejectable thread that causes a sting.

- Mesoglea vs Mesoderm
    - Mesoglea (in diploblastic specimens)
        - Mesoglea, also known as mesohyl, is the translucent, non-living,
          jelly-like substance found between the two epithelial cell layers
          (i.e., between the ectoderm and endoderm) in the bodies of cnidarians
          and sponges.
    - Mesoderm (in triploblastic specimens)
        - In all bilaterian animals, the mesoderm is one of the three primary
          germ layers in the very early embryo.

- Symmetry
    - Asymmetrical
        - Porifera
    - Radial
        - Cnidarian
        - "Aboral"
    - Bilateria
        - Anterior
        - Posterior
        - Ventral
        - Dorsal

    - In Cnidaria
        - In terms of development, the blastopore (the opening the gastrula)
          becomes the single opening for digestion, and acts as both a mouth and
          an anus.

        - The archenteron becomes the gastrovascular cavity.

        - The generations flip / flop between polyp and medusa forms.

- Protostomes vs Deuterostomes
    - Protostomes
        - Determinate cleavage
        - "Mouth develops first" (from blastopore)
        - Can't have twins
    - Deuterostomes (echinoderms and chordates)
        - Indeterminate cleavage
        - "Mouth develops second" (from blastopore) (anus develops first)
        - Can have twins

    - Body Plans of Bilateria
        -Early development (protostome vs deuterstome; trochophore larva)
            - A trochophore larva is a developmental phase present in some
              protostomes
        - Coelom (body cavity)
        - Segmentation
        - Ecdysis (hard outer cuticle that must be shed periodically for the
          animal to grow)

Animal Diversity Part 3 ("continued in slides 15")
================================================================================

-Bilateria
    - Advantages of a Coelom
        - Definition
            - A fluid-filled body cavity found in triploblastic organisms
            - A “true coelom” is surrounded by the mesoderm (specimen with true
              coeloms -> "eucoelomates")
                - As a reminder:
                    - Pseudocoelom develops between the mesoderm and endoderm

        1) Provides room for complex, independently moving organs

        2) Provides a hydrostatic skeleton for movement
            - Because water is “non-compressible”, if you apply pressure to a
              fluid-filled cavity in one direction, it will cause the cavity to
              lengthen in a direction perpendicular to the direction of
              pressure.

            - Two layers of muscles
                1) Longitudinal muscle that runs the length of the coelom
                    - When the longitudinal muscles contract, the coelom
                      shortens but its diameter increases
                    - Compress the coelom; shorten the body

                2) Circular muscle wrapping around the coelom like a ring
                    - Conversely, when the circular muscles contract, the coelom
                      decreases its diameter but becomes more elongate.
                    - Squeeze the coelom; elongate the body
    - Protostomes
        - Ecdysozoans (hard-bodied)
            - Hard-bodied invertebrates, where the hard body is a protective
              exoskeletons.  In order to grow, they need to periodically molt
              there exoskeleton in a process called “ecdysis”.
            - Examples
                - Arthropoda (crabs, lobsters)
                - Nematoda
        - Lophotrochozoans (soft-bodied)
            - Soft-bodied (sometimes protected by a shell) invertebrates which
              can grow continuously.  Many of them start off life soon after
              gastrulation as tiny, free-swimming “trochophore larvae” before
              developing into their adult forms.
            - Examples
                - Annelida (Segmentation)
                - Mollusca
                - Platyhelminthes (Acoelomates)
    - Deuterostomes
        - Chordata
            - Segmentation
                - Bones are segmented
                - Muscles are segmented
        - Echinodermata (Radial symmetry, or pentaradiate)


    - Segmentation
        - Definition
            - Repeated body units
            - Has evolved independently among several animal phyla
                - Anthropods
                - Chordata
                - Annelida
        - When animals have repeated body units
            - Can enhance the flexibility of movement
            - Different segments can be specialized for different functions
        - Annelids can elongate and compress individual segments independently
          of each other.
            - Not just one hydrostatic skeleton, but each segment is its own
              hydrostatic skeleton.
        - Tagmata
            - Segments in specific regions that work together to carry out
              specific sets of functions within anthropods.
                - Insects
                    - Head
                    - Thorax
                    - Abdomen
                        - Digestive
                        - Reproduction
                - Crustacea (crabs and crayfish)
                    - Cephalothorax
                    - Abdomen

- Multicellular Eukaryotic Organisms
    - Plants, Animals, Fungi
