Animals:
    - Key Common Traits Among All/Most Animals:
        - Eukaryotic
        - Multicellular
        - No Cell Walls
        - Extracellular Matrix (with collagen)
            - Collagen:
                - Protein unique to animals, present in all animals
                - "Glues" things together
        - Heterotrophic (animals generally “engulf” their food)
            - Vs autotrophic
                - Beings that generate their own food
                    - Ex: Like plants do with photosynthesis
        - Movement (typically involving nerves and muscle)
            - Also, cilia and flagella
        - Cleavage (a type of mitosis occurring during very early embryonic
          development)

Background Information:
    -Mitosis vs Meiosis
        - Definition
            - Processes which describe the production of new cells
        - Mitosis
            - Produces 2 daughter cells which are genetically identical to the
              parent cell
            - Each daughter cell is diploid (contains the normal number of
              chromosomes).
            - Mitosis is used in growth and asexual reproduction.
        - Meiosis
            - Produces 4 daughter cells, each of which are unidentical to the
              parent cell and to one another.
            - Each daughter cell is haploid (contains half the number of normal
              chromosomes).
            - There are two cell divisions: the parent cell divides once and
              then each cell produced by this first division divides once.
            - Used to produce gametes (sperm and egg cells), the cells of sexual
              reproduction. Two gametes fuse to form a zygote, a diploid cell
              with the full number of chromosomes.

    - Haploid, Diploid, Triploid ...
        - Definition:
            - Describe the amount of chromosomes in the cell
        - Haploid: 1n
        - Diploid: 2n
            - Most mammals are diploid
                - 23 Chromosome PAIRS (2n = 2 * 23 = 46)
                - The haploid number for humans is 23
        - Triploid: 3n
        - Tetraploid: 4n

    - Gamete
        - A mature haploid male or female germ cell which is able to unite with
          another of the opposite sex in sexual reproduction to form a zygote

Cleavage (what makes it different from other types of mitosis?)
    - Very rapid cell division
    - Synchronized cell division
    - Cells get progressively smaller with each division (i.e., no net increase
      in the size of the embryo)
    - Cleavage is a type of MITOTIC cell division only known to occur in the
      earliest stages of animal development
    * At the end of cleavage, the embryo becomes a "BLASTULA"
        - "Blast-": something that will develop into something else
    * It is after the blastula stage that development begins to vary among
      animal phyla

    - Process
        1) 2 haploid gametes (egg and sperm germ cells) fuse to become a diploid
           zygote.
        2) This zygote begins to rapidly "cleave" until it becomes a blastula
            - Morula: an intermediate stage during cleavage where the embryo
              resembles a “mulberry” 
            - The center of of the blastula is called a "blastocoel"
                - "-coel": Having a chamber or cavity
            - The cells here are undifferentiated
