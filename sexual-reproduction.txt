- Monoecious
    - Have both male and female sexual reproduction organs
        - Hermaphrodites
    - Each individual is capable of reproducing both gametes (eggs and sperm)
    - Self-fertilization is possible in some cases, but most cases require
      finding a mate
    - Ex:
        - Annelida,
        - Porifera,
        - Cnidaria,
        - Urochordata,
        - Gastropoda,
        - Platyhelminthes,
            - Tapeworm (Parasitic Platyhelminthes)
                - Resort to self-fertilization, as it is hard to find other
                  mates inside the reproductive tracts of the hosts they live
                  off of.

- Dioecious
    - Each individual is distinctively male or female
    - Ex:
        - Mollusca (except for gastropods),
        - Chordata (except for urochordates),
        - Echinodermata,
        - Arthropoda,
        - Nematoda

- Types of Fertilization
    - Internal
        -Def
            - Fertilization outside the female reproductive tract
        * Restricted to aquatic environments

    - External
        - Def
            - Fertilization inside the female reproductive tract
        - Required for terrestrial fertilization, but can occur in aquatic
          environments
        * Fertilization occurs within the female reproductive tract
        - Structures are required to deliver the sperm to the femaleâ€™s
          reproductive tract
            - Intermittent (or copulatory) organ
            - Spermatophore
                - Like an egg or vessel to hold sperm ?
