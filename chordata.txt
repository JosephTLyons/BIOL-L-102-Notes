Phylum Chordata
    - Examples
        * Vertebrates
            - Humans
        - Lancelet
        - Sea squirts

    - Key Body Plan Features
        - Bilateral symmetry
        - Triploblastic
        - Alimentary canal
            - The whole passage along which food passes through the body from
              mouth to anus. It includes the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.
        - Eucoelomate
            - Have a coelom (a cavity surrounding the digestive tract)
        - Deuterostome
            - Digestive tract develops mouth second (anus first)
        - Segmentation

    - Other Features Unique to Chordates
        - All chordates have these four features during at least one point in
          their life
            1) Dorsal Hollow nerve cord
            2) Phyaryngeal gill slits
                - Openings between the pharynx, or throat, and the outside
            3) Notochord
                - A cartilaginous skeletal rod supporting the body in all
                  embryonic and some adult chordate animals
            4) Post-anal tail
                - All chordates have a post-anal tail. A post-anal tail is an
                  extension of the body that runs past the anal opening.
                - In some species, like humans, this feature is only present
                  during the embryonic stage.
        - Phylum Chordata can be divided into different subphyla based on
          what happens to the notochord
            - Cephalochordata (head)
                - The notochord extends the entire length of the animal,
                  including into the “head” (hence “cephalo-”)
                - Cephalochordates are the only chordates to retain their
                  notochord as adults
            - Urochordata (tail)
                - The notochord is only present in the tail of the animal
                  (hence “uro-” which means “tail”)
                - As adults, urochordates lose their tails and become sessile
                  animals called “sea squirts”)
            - Vertebrata
                - The notochord is replaced during early development by a
                  series of vertebrae
                - Vertebrata are also the only chordates to have extensive
                  brain development and a protective “cranium” around their
                  brain
