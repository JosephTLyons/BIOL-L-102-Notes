    - Lab 7: (Vertebrates)
        1) General concepts in lab:
            - Homology
            - Convergent evolution
                - Ex: How unrelated animals all developed the same type of teeth
                    - Molars and diastema for herbivores
                    - Mixture of incisors, canines, and molars for omnivores
                      (heterodonts)
                    - Mostly incisors for carnivores and insectivores
            - Adaptive radiation
        2) Skeleton of cat and human
            - know all things here: animal-anatomy-and-function.txt
            - be able to differentiate between the cat vertebrae
            - Use lab 7 quiz as well

            - be able to identify each bone
            - be able to connect structure of bone to function
        3) Mammalian teeth and skull features
            - Heterodont: (incisors, canines, pre-molars, molars)
                - Mammals only
            - Homodont: (fish, reptiles)
            - Be able to classify skulls as omnivore, herbivore, or carnivore
            - Be able to relate skull, jaw, and tooth features to diet
                - Angle of jaw articulation
                    - If the jaw has room to move laterally (grind), it
                      indicates that it could be a herbivore
                - Temporalis and masseter muscle attachments
                - Coronoid process: use to attach temporal muscle to jaw; a
                  large coronoid process indicates large temporal muscle, which
                  indicates the specimen is a carnivore.
                - Structure of canines, molars, presence / absence of diastema

Dorsal: Back
Ventral: Belly
Anterior: located to the front, or in front of
Posterior: located to the back, or in back of

- Lab 8 (Invertebrates):
    1) Internal and External anatomy of squid
        - Refer to image in Lab7_Squid_Crayfish_InvertPhylaMaterials.pptx

        - Orientation
            - Anterior: Side of the eyes, opposite of siphon
            - Posterior: Side of the siphon (dissection side)
            - Dorsal: By the fin
            - Ventral: Foot (tentacles and arms)

        - Structures and their functions
            - Mantle: Sheath-like structure that fits over the top of the squid
            - Tentacles (2): longer of the appendages
            - Arms (8): shorter of the appendages
            - Buccal mass: region that contains / surrounds the beak, connects
              to the esophagus
            - Beak: (like that of a bird)
            - Radula: Tongue covered in tiny teeth-like structures
            - Gill: long rod-like structures in the mantle through which the
              squid obtains oxygen
            - Eye
            - Siphon (Multi-functional): used for movement (fills mantle with
              water to breath and shoots it out of the siphon), disposal of
              waste, sperm or eggs leave through the siphon as well
            - Siphon retractor muscles: support and position the funnel during
              propulsion
            - Cephalic retractor muscles: involved with movement of the head
            - Penis
            - Vas deferens: the duct which conveys sperm from the testicle to
              the urethra.
            - Oviductal gland: creates the shell around the egg
            - Nidamental gland: coats eggs with protective covering before
              release (after oviductal gland creates the egg shell)
            - Testes / Ovaries: In the mantle, located on the dorsal side
            - Ink sac: between the gills
            - Rectum: Tube that places waste in the siphon to be ejected
            - Pen: A structure made of chitin located near the dorsal area and
              supports the squid's muscular tissues and organs, runs the length
              of the squid.  Homologous to the shell (or valve) in the bivalve.
              There is no proper shell left in cephalopods, the pen is all that
              is left that relates to it.
            - Branchial Heart: found at the base of each gill near the center of
              the squid, both attach to a systemic heart
            - Systemic Heart: a central heart that the branchial hearts attach
              to
            - Stomach
            - Cecum: a thin walled extension of the stomach that continues
              towards the dorsal tip of the mantle, produces digestive enzymes

    2) Internal and External anatomy of crayfish
        - Refer to image in Lab7_Squid_Crayfish_InvertPhylaMaterials.pptx

        - Orientation
            - Anterior: front, by chelipeds
            - Posterior: back, by tail
            - Dorsal: back, abdomen and cephalothorax side
            - Ventral: belly, swimmeret side

        - Structures and their functions
            - Male has hard copulatory swimmerets
            - Female has soft swimmerets and an opening just above them, seminal
              receptacle.  They also other openings above the seminal
              receptacle, which dispenses the eggs, called the:
            - Ovaduct openings
            - Compound eye and eyestalk
            - Cephalothorax: main body (where legs and pinchers attach)
            - Abdomen: lower body (tail region, swimmeret region)
            - Open heart system
            - Cardiac stomach: right behind eyes, is in the head
            - Pyloric stomach: right behind the cardiac stomach
            - Digestive glands surround the pyloric stomach
            - Gills are on the left and right side of the heart
            - Heart in lower cephalothorax
            - Ovaries or testes are in the same region as heart, but under it
            - Separate mouth and anus
            - Uropod: flaps on either side of the tail (telson)
            - Telson: Tip of the abdomen, located between the two uropods
            - 8 walking legs
            - 2 Chela (pinchers)
            - Mandibles: feeding appendages

            - Tagmata (segments with similar structure and function that
              collectively merge together)
                - In crayfish
                    - Cephalothorax: segments here have fussed to form a
                        - Carapace:
                            - Rostrum: point formed at top of carapace

                    - Abdomen

            - Have hard exteriors made of chitin called exoskeleton.  Molting,
              or shedding of this exoskeleton, is required for the crayfish to
              grow.

            - Male places sperm in the seminal receptacle with his male
              copulatory swimmerets.  Eggs come out of the ovaduct, receive
              sperm from seminal receptacle and are fertilized, then the
              female's swimmerets capture and hold the eggs.  Therefore,
              fertilization is external.

    p             finger-like projections of the cell membrane that trap
    l             food particles.  Their flagella beat, creating a water flow
    e             across the microvilli, which then filter out nutrients from

                        - Have 2 shells (bi-valve) that are hinged together
                        - When they die, the ligament that hinges the two shells
                          together breaks down faster than the shell, so we are
                          left with only the single shell.
                        - The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with
