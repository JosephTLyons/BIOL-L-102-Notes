- Molecular Biology
    - Definition:
        - A branch of biology that deals directly with the molecules that allow
          a cell to function.
        - Concerned with DNA replication (The Central Dogma of Molecular
          Biology)

    - Restriction Enzymes
        - Proteins whose function is to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid.
            - These enzymes break the a specific covalent bond between
              nucleotides in a strand.
        - Cut DNA
        - Example
            - EcoRI

    - Restriction Sites
        - A very specific sequence of nitrogenous bases that each restriction
          enzyme recognizes
        - Usually are palindromes

    - Ligases glue DNA

    - Electrophoresis
        - Refers to the movement of molecules in an electrical field, due to the
          attraction between charges on the molecule and opposite charge on the
          electrode.
        - The molecules are placed in a gel, which provides an obstacle for
          these molecules as they are being "pushed" by the electrical charge.
        - The gel is a meshwork of large inert polymers
            - Carbohydrates such as agarose
        - DNA is negatively charged, it moves from the negative side to the
          positive side.
        - DNA Ladder is the "standard"
        - If charge on the molecules is the same, then the size of the molecule
          is what determines how far it travels through the meshwork.
            - Smaller particles can move more freely and will move further down
