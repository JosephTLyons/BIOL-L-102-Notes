Dogma Definition: A truth everyone must agree on

The Central Dogma: the currently accepted theory of protein synthesis

================================================================================
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology describes the two-step process,
transcription and translation, by which the information in genes flows into
proteins: DNA -> RNA -> Protein.

It is often stated as "DNA makes RNA and RNA makes Protein."
================================================================================

DNA
    - Consists of two strands of nucleotides (Guanine-Cytosine, Adenine-Thymine)
    - Template Strand (3' to 5') vs Coding Strand (5' to 3')

RNA
    - Consists of a single strand of nucleotides (Guanine-Cytosine, 
      Adenine-Uracil)

Proteins (polypeptides)
    - Consists of a sequence of amino acids (20 different types)

================================================================================

Transcription (in Eukaryotes):
    - DNA -> mRNA (messenger RNA)
    - Information from DNA (a long chain of “nucleotides” present in the nucleus
      of the cell) is copied as mRNA (a shorter chain of nucleotides that can
      move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm)
    - The genes are sequences of DNA that contain the information for making
      proteins
    - Transcription occurs in the nucleus

    ============================================================================

    - Template Strand (3' to 5')

    - Coding Strand (5' to 3')
        - If we are given Template strand, Coding strand is generated by
          swapping:
            - G <-> C
            - A <-> T

    - Creation of an mRNA
        1) pre-RNA strand (intermediate step to make mRNA)
            - Technically made from the template strand
            - But it is easier to just copy the coding strand, swapping the
              'T' for 'U'

            Promoter
                - Short segment of DNA that marks the location of a gene in DNA.
                  This is where the transcription factor molecules will bind.
                  An enzyme called RNA polymerase is introduced at the sit of
                  the transcription factor molecule.

                    - RNA polymerase will make an RNA transcript of the gene.
                        1) Initiation:
                            - RNA polymerase attaches to where Transcription
                              Factors attach to the promotor region of a
                              specific gene on the template strand.
                        2) Elongation:
                            - Run down the template strand, zipping and
                              unzipping the strands while making an pre-RNA
                              transcript
                        3) Termination
                            - Pops off the template strand, leaving the new
                              pre-RNA strand for the next step.
            - Example
                - Template: 3' ACCAAACCGAGT 5'
                - Coding:   5' TGGTTTGGCTCA 3'
                - mRNA:     5' UGGUUUGGCUCA 3' (before removing introns)

        2) Made from the RNA strand after removing the useless information
           segments called "introns" via the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
           (snRNPs)
            - 4 of these get together and form a spliceosome (ring-shape) to
              remove the intron, leaving only just the exons (contains
              information for making proteins) and a complete mRNA strand.
            - After all the introns are removed, a 5' cap is put on the left
              side of the RNA transcript and a PolyA Tail (AAA...) is placed on
              the right side (where the 3' would go) (terminal end)
                - PolyA is a chain of adenosine molecules.

            Page 36 of notes has a drawing of this

                   snRNPs that form spliceosomes (ring-like structures) to
                   |      remove introns
                   v
                   oo       oo      oo       oo      oo       oo
            --------=========--------=========--------=========--------
                   oo       oo      oo       oo      oo       oo

            5'cap --------|--------|--------|-------- polyA tail

            where '|' mark where an intron was removes leaving only exons

        Review:
            1) An RNA transcript is made using the template strand of DNA
            2) Introns are removed (by snRNPs and Spliceosomes)
            3) 5' added to left, PolyA (AAA...) is added to right (3' side)

Translation (in Eukaryotes):
    - mRNA -> A sequence of amino acids (polypeptides and proteins)
    - When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm
      where the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is used to generate a
      corresponding sequence of amino acids (i.e., a polypeptide, or protein)
    - Most translation occurs in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, as that's
      where most of the ribosomes are, but translation can occur elsewhere where
      ribosomes might show up (such as the cytosol).

    - Ribosome consists of 2 components:
        1) Large Subunit
        2) Small Subunit

        Both are made from RNA and Protein in the nucleus

    - Steps have the same names as in transcription during the RNA polymerase
      step (it seems whenever a structure attaches to some for of DNA/RNA, they
      have the same step names):

        1) Initiation
            - Involves the assembly of the ribosome structure around the mRNA

                      sequence of nucleotides
                      (protein building region)
