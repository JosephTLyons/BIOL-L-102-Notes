Dogma Definition: A truth everyone must agree on

The Central Dogma: the currently accepted theory of protein synthesis

================================================================================
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology describes the two-step process,
transcription and translation, by which the information in genes flows into
proteins: DNA -> RNA -> Protein.

It is often stated as "DNA codes for RNA and RNA codes for Protein."
================================================================================

DNA
    - Consists of two strands of nucleotides (Guanine-Cytosine, Adenine-Thymine)
    - Template Strand (3' to 5') vs Coding Strand (5' to 3')

RNA
    - Consists of a single strand of nucleotides (Guanine-Cytosine,
      Adenine-Uracil)

Proteins (polypeptides)
    - Consists of a sequence of amino acids (20 different types)

================================================================================

Transcription (in Eukaryotes):
    - DNA -> mRNA (messenger RNA)
    - Information from DNA (a long chain of “nucleotides” present in the nucleus
      of the cell) is copied as mRNA (a shorter chain of nucleotides that can
      move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm)
    - The genes are sequences of DNA that contain the information for making
      proteins
    - Transcription occurs in the nucleus

    ============================================================================

    - Template Strand (3' to 5')

    - Coding Strand (5' to 3')
        - If we are given Template strand, Coding strand is generated by
          swapping:
            - G <-> C
            - A <-> T

    - Creation of an mRNA
        1) pre-mRNA strand (intermediate step to make mRNA)
            - Technically made from the template strand
            - But it is easier to just copy the coding strand, swapping the
              'T' for 'U'

            |                    | Terminator
            Promoter
                - Short segment of DNA that marks the location of a gene in DNA.
                  This is where the transcription factor molecules will bind.
                  An enzyme called RNA polymerase is introduced at the sit of
                  the transcription factor molecule.

                    - RNA polymerase will make an RNA transcript of the gene.
                        1) Initiation:
                            - RNA polymerase attaches to where Transcription
                              Factors attach to the promotor region of a
                              specific gene on the template strand.
                        2) Elongation:
                            - Run down the template strand, zipping and
                              unzipping the strands while making a pre-mRNA
                              transcript
                        3) Termination
                            - Pops off the template strand, leaving the new
                              pre-mRNA strand for the next step.
            - Example
                - Template: 3' ACCAAACCGAGT 5'
                - Coding:   5' TGGTTTGGCTCA 3'
                - mRNA:     5' UGGUUUGGCUCA 3' (before removing introns)

        2) Made from the RNA strand after removing the useless information
           segments called "introns" via the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
           (snRNPs)
            - 4 of these get together and form a spliceosome (ring-shape) to
              remove the intron, leaving only just the exons (contains
              information for making proteins) and a complete mRNA strand.
            - After all the introns are removed, a 5' cap is put on the left
              side of the RNA transcript and a PolyA Tail (AAA...) is placed on
              the right side (where the 3' would go) (terminal end)
                - PolyA is a chain of adenosine molecules.

            Page 36 of notes has a drawing of this

                   snRNPs that form spliceosomes (ring-like structures) to
                   |      remove introns
                   v
                   oo       oo      oo       oo      oo       oo
            --------=========--------=========--------=========--------
                   oo       oo      oo       oo      oo       oo

            5'cap --------|--------|--------|-------- polyA tail

            where '|' mark where an intron was removes leaving only exons

        Review:
            1) An RNA transcript is made using the template strand of DNA
            2) Introns are removed (by snRNPs and Spliceosomes)
            3) 5' added to left, PolyA (AAA...) is added to right (3' side)

Translation (in Eukaryotes):
    - mRNA -> A sequence of amino acids (polypeptides and proteins)
    - When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm
      where the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is used to generate a
      corresponding sequence of amino acids (i.e., a polypeptide, or protein)
    - Most translation occurs in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, as that's
      where most of the ribosomes are, but translation can occur elsewhere where
      ribosomes might show up (such as the cytosol).

    - Ribosome consists of 2 components:
        1) Large Ribosomal Subunit
        2) Small Ribosomal Subunit

        Both are made from RNA and Protein in the nucleus

    - Steps have the same names as in transcription during the RNA polymerase
      step (it seems whenever a structure attaches to some for of DNA/RNA, they
      have the same step names):

        1) Initiation
            - Involves the assembly of the ribosome structure around the mRNA

                      sequence of nucleotides
                      (protein building region)
                      .............................

                   ------
                  |      | - Small subunit attaches on bottom
                   ------  - As a note, the large subunit attaches on top,
                             "sandwiching" the mRNA transcript.
                           - Links by base pairs

            - Codon Definition:
                - A sequence of 3 nucleotides that "code" for a specific amino
                  acid.
                - Codons refers the ones in the mRNA

            - The 1st codon in a polypeptide coding sequence is always
              methionine.  It is considered the "start codon" and its
              represented by "AUG."

            - Each amino acid is brought by transferRNA (tRNA), which has set of
              3 nitrogenous bases called the "anticodon" that link with a codon
              in the mRNA.
                - tRNA has "stems" and "loops."
                * remember, we are dealing with RNA here, so linking of base
                  pairs in the codons and the anticodons are: G-C, A-U

            * Note, at this point, the large ribosomal subunit is sitting on top
              of the mRNA with each tRNA in either the E, P, or A region.

            * Summary of Initiation
                - The large and small ribosomal subunits attach to the mRNA at
                  the start codon site ("AUG")

        2) Elongation
            - The linking of individual amino acids after forming base pairs
              with the codons of mRNA and anticodons of tRNA.

            - We are still at the site of the start codon, "AUG," or methionine.

            - E, P, and A sites
                - A: Amino acyl (Right)
                    - Where new AMINOACYL tRNA molecules come in to bind to the
                      mRNA
                        - AMINOACYL tRNA: has an amino acid
                        - Note: the these can only enter the A site if they have
                          the correct anticodon for the matching codon in the
                          mRNA in the A site.
                    - Condensation reaction occurs between amino acid in this
                      site and amino acid in P site, forming a peptide bond
                - P: Polypeptide / Protein) (Middle)
                - E: Exit (Left)
                    - Where old "uncharged" tRNA molecules leaves
                        - "Uncharged" = lost its amino acid when it linked to
                          another via condensation reaction (peptide bond)

            - It should be noted that after a peptide bond is formed between
              amino acids in the P and A sites, that the whole structure (both
              small and large subunits) move down the line one codon (3 base
              pairs) to the right.

            - Polypeptide chain grows during elongation as moves one codon at a
              time down the mRNA.

            - Elongation occurs until a stop codon is reached

        3) Termination
            - A stop codon is reached
                - It enters the A site
                - A release factor is a tRNA shaped protein that can enter the
                  A site when a stop codon is present on the mRNA strand.
                    - Causes process to end: Large Subunit, Small Subunit, and
                      polypeptide chain all dissociate from the mRNA

Mutations can occur during translation (and transcription ?)
    - Generalized effects of a mutation
	    - N: Neutral
	         (no change in protein function)

	    - B: Beneficial
             (enhancement in protein function)

	    - D: Deleterious (from the word "delete")
             (reduction or loss of protein function)

    - Categories of Mutations:
        1) Point Mutations
            - Definition:
                - Substituting one nucleotide for another

            - Silent mutation (N)
                - Results in synonymous codon (no change at all)
                - (e.g. AGA -> AGG, still codes for arginine)

            - Missense mutation (B, N, D)
                - Results in a change from one amino acid to another
                - (e.g. AGA -> GGA, changes from arginine to glycine)

            - Nonsense mutation (D)
                - Results in a change from a regular codon to a stop codon
                - (e.g. AGA -> UGA, changes from arginine to ‘stop’)
                - Mnemonic: "non-stop"

        2) Frameshift Mutations (D)
            - Insertion or deletion of one or more NUCLEOTIDES (not codon), affecting
              every codon downstream from the mutation
