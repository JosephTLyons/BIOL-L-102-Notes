- Lab 7: (Vertebrates)
    1) General concepts in lab:
        - Homology
        - Convergent evolution
            - Ex: How unrelated animals all developed the same type of teeth
                - Molars and diastema for herbivores
                - Mixture of incisors, canines, and molars for omnivores
                  (heterodonts)
                - Mostly incisors for carnivores and insectivores
        - Adaptive radiation
    2) Skeleton of cat and human
        - know all things here: animal-anatomy-and-function.txt
        - be able to differentiate between the cat vertebrae
        - Use lab 7 quiz as well

        - be able to identify each bone
        - be able to connect structure of bone to function
    3) Mammalian teeth and skull features
        - Heterodont: (incisors, canines, pre-molars, molars)
            - Mammals only
        - Homodont: (fish, reptiles)
        - Be able to classify skulls as omnivore, herbivore, or carnivore
        - Be able to relate skull, jaw, and tooth features to diet
            - Angle of jaw articulation
                - If the jaw has room to move laterally (grind), it
                  indicates that it could be a herbivore
            - Temporalis and masseter muscle attachments
            - Coronoid process: use to attach temporal muscle to jaw; a
              large coronoid process indicates large temporal muscle, which
              indicates the specimen is a carnivore.
            - Structure of canines, molars, presence / absence of diastema
