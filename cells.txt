Two competing theories in the early 19th century:
    1. spontaneous generation (was dropped)
    2. cell theory (was accepted)

What is a cell?
    - Smallest self-sustaining unit of life
    - Generally microscopic (but some can be seen with naked eye)
    - Internal aqueous environment (cytosol) that differs from the aqueous
      environment that surrounds it
    - Surrounded by plasma membrane (cell membrane) consisting of phospholipid
      bilayer with embedded proteins
    - Cells make proteins and the function(s) of a given cell are linked to the
      proteins the cell makes
    - The proteins are generally made of RNA and the information form making
      proteins is in the form of DNA, ribosomes are present
    - It has mechanisms for making ATP, the main direct source for most of its
      activities.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
    - An adenine nucleotide with three phosphate groups instead of one
    - The linkage between the 2nd and 3rd phosphate contains a large amount of
      chemical energy that can be transferred to other molecules, providing
      activation energy for many chemical reactions in the cell to occur.
    - ATP <-> ADP + Psub(i)

All cells have
    - Cell membrane
    - Cytosol / cytoplasm
        - Cytoplasm = all items inside cell but nucleus
        - Cytosol = cytoplasm - organelles
    - Cytoskeleton
    - A specific region for storing DNA
    - A mechanism for making ATP
    - Ribosomes for making proteins

Common structures found in some cells, but not others
    - Cell walls
    - Organelles
        - A specialized structure or region within a cell, dedicated to
          performing specific function(s), like that of human organs.
        - Are surrounded in a membrane (phospholipid membrane)
            - see organelles.txt

Organelles move around the cell via a framework called the cytoskeleton.

The phospholipid bilayer of cells have embedded proteins to help facilitate with
movement of things that cant pass through the membrane between the
phospholipids, such as ions, molecules, information, etc.

Generalized prokaryotic cell
    - Flagellum
        - aids in movement of the cell
    - Cytoplasm
        - all items inside cell minus the nucleus
    - Ribosomes
        - used for building polypeptides
    - Nucleoid
        - Single, circular, chromosome
        - Mostly composed of multiple compacted copies of DNA in a
          continuous thread, with the addition of some RNA and proteins.
        - not an organelle because no phospholipid bilayer, similar to nucleus,
          but is not the same.
    - Plasma membrane
        - a microscopic membrane of lipids and proteins which forms the external
          boundary of the cytoplasm of a cell or encloses a vacuole, and
          regulates the passage of molecules in and out of the cytoplasm.
    - Cell wall
        - a rigid layer of polysaccharides lying outside the plasma membrane of
          the cells of plants, fungi, and bacteria. In the algae and higher
          plants it consists mainly of cellulose.
    - Plasmid
        - small segment ring of DNA, (only present in prokaryotes)
        - Ring-shaped
        - Found int cytoplasm
        - Only enough DNA for 1 or 2 proteins
        - Can be exchanged among cells, can be replicated independently of the
          whole cell

3 Domains to classify living things
    - Bacteria (prokaryotes)
    - Archaea (prokaryotes)
    - Eukaryota

Whittaker 5 Kingdom
    - Plants, Fungi, Animals at top (eukaryotes)
    - Protistans at middle (eukaryotes)
    - Monerans at bottom (prokaryotes)

Protist examples
    - Volvox (death star)
    - Stentor (paddle-shaped)
    - Amoeba
        - Animal-like protist
    - Euglena (like animal cells, non-geometric shapes)
        - Plant-like protist
    - Scenedesmus (green disk-like stacks)
    - Paramecium (boot-shaped)
    - Slime mold
        - Fungi-like protist

Bacteria                  | Archaea            | Eukaryotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nucleoid                                       | Nucleus
Circular Chromosomes (in nucleoid)             | Linear Chromosomes (in nucleus)
Plasmids                                       | No plasmids
No organelles (generally)                      | Many organelles
Rotary Flagellum (spins)                       | Undulatory Flagellum (waves)
Fatty acid-based          | Isoprene-based     | Fatty acid-based phospholipid
    phospholipid          |     phospholipid   |
Peptidoglycans            | No peptidoglycans, if walls are present, they are
                          |     made of other polysaccharides
No histone proteins       | Histone proteins present in cells
                          | Shared feature of protein synthesis

* Know similarities and differences: bacteria and archaea, bacteria and
Eukaryotes, archaea and eukaryotes

First amino acid in the sequence for archaea and eukaryotes: methionine
Ribosomes of eukaryotes and archaea are more similar than the ribosomes of
bacteria.

Flagella
    - prokaryotes
        - Flagella in prokaryotes extend out of the shell
        - Rotate
        - Aren't considered organelles, since they have no membrane.
        - They are anchored in the cell membrane / cell wall.
    - Eukaryotes
        - Flagella in eukaryotes are covered by membrane
        - Undulate (move in waves).
        - Are considered organelles
        - They are anchored to basal bodies, which are centriole-like structures
          inside the cytoplasm.

LUCA = Last Universal Common Ancestor - an ancestor that links prokaryotes and
eukaryotes (more than likely a billion years ago or more)

Cell Walls
    - Animal: no cell wall
    - Plant: wall made of cellulose
    - Fungi: wall made of chitin
        - Cells arranged in linear, branching threads called “hyphae”
            - Septate hyphae - is separated into compartments
            - Coenocytic hyphae - is not separated into compartments
