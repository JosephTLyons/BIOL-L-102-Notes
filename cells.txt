Two competing theories in the early 19th century:
    1. spontaneous generation (was dropped)
    2. cell theory (was accepted)

What is a cell?
    - Smallest self-sustaining unit of life
    - Generally microscopic (but some can be seen with naked eye)
    - Internal aqueous environment (cytosol) that differs from the aqueous
      environment that surrounds it
    - Surrounded by plasma membrane (cell membrane) consisting of phospholipid
      bilayer with embedded proteins
    - Cells make proteins and the function(s) of a given cell are linked to the
      proteins the cell makes
    - The proteins are generally made of RNA and the information form making
      proteins is in the form of DNA, ribosomes are present
    - It has mechanisms for making ATP, the main direct source for most of its
      activities.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
    - an adenine nucleotide with three phosphate groups instead of one
