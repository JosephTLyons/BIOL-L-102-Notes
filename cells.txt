Two competing theories in the early 19th century:
    1. spontaneous generation (was dropped)
    2. cell theory (was accepted)

What is a cell?
    - Smallest self-sustaining unit of life
    - Generally microscopic (but some can be seen with naked eye)
    - Internal aqueous environment (cytosol) that differs from the aqueous
      environment that surrounds it
