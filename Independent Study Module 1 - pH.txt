Independent Module 1 Notes (Acids, Bases, and Buffers):

Neutrality:

- [H^+] = [OH^-].  When water has this equilibrium, it has a neutral pH (7)
- "[H^+]" is read as "the concentration of hydrogen ions."
- The pH (potential Hydrogen) comes from the inverse log of [H^+].  Neutral is
  7.0 (the 7 comes from 1 x 10^-7)
- pH scales goes from 0 - 14

Acids (pH below 7):

- Increases in [H^+], decreases in pH
- The highest [H^+] possible in an aqueous (water-based) solution is 1 mol/L,
  which corresponds to a pH of 0
- The water wants to force the excess H^+ atoms onto others molecules

Bases (pH above 7)

- Decreases in [H^+], increases in pH
- The lowest [H+] possible in an aqueous solution is 1 x 10-14 which corresponds
  to a pH of 14
- The water wants to gain missing H^+ atoms by trying to extract them from other
  molecules

Buffers:
- Buffers are molecules that can act either as acids or bases, releasing H^+ to
  the solution if the pH is too high or picking up H^+ from the solution if the
  pH is low; buffers tend to stabilize pH.
- 3 main buffers in the body:
    - Bicarbonate
    - Phosphate
    - Proteins
