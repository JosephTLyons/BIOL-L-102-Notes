                      after it enters through the ostia
                    - Choanocytes: specialized feeding cells, a ring of
                      finger-like projections of the cell membrane that trap
                      food particles
                    - Ostia: many small pores where water enters
                    - Spicules: Sharp 3 pointed-star item made of silicone,
