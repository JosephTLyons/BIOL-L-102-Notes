              squid obtains oxygen
            - Eye
            - Siphon (Multi-functional): used for movement (fills mantle with
              water to breath and shoots it out of the siphon), disposal of
              waste, sperm or eggs leave through the siphon as well
            - Siphon retractor muscles: support and position the funnel during
              propulsion

              supports the squid's muscular tissues and organs, runs the length
              of the squid.
            - Branchial Heart: found at the base of each gill near the center of
              the squid, both attach to a systemic heart
            - Systemic Heart: a central heart that the branchial hearts attach
              to

    p           - Asymmetrical
    l           - Lack of true tissue

                  finger-like projections of the cell membrane that trap
                  food particles.  Their flagella beat, creating a water flow
                  across the microvilli, which then filter out nutrients from
                  the water.
                - Ostia: many small pores where water enters
