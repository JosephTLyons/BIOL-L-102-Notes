              squid obtains oxygen
            - Eye
            - Siphon (Multi-functional): used for movement (fills mantle with
              water to breath and shoots it out of the siphon), disposal of
              waste, sperm or eggs leave through the siphon as well
            - Siphon retractor muscles: support and position the funnel during
              propulsion

            - Ink sac: between the gills
            - Rectum: Tube that places waste in the siphon to be ejected
            - Pen: A structure made of chitin located near the dorsal area and
              supports the squid's muscular tissues and organs, runs the length
              of the squid.
            - Branchial Heart: found at the base of each gill near the center of
              the squid, both attach to a systemic heart
            - Systemic Heart: a central heart that the branchial hearts attach
              to
