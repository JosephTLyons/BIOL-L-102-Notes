- Meiosis
    - A type of cell division in which 1 2n cell undergoes sets
      of divisions to end up as 4 haploid daughter cells, each
      of which is genetically different
        - requires even number of chromosomes:
            - diploid, tetraploid, ...
- Mitosis
    - A type of cell division in which a cell (of any ploidy)
      divides once to end up as 2 genetically identical daughter
      cells
    - Mnemonic: MiTosis -> TWO -> TWINS

- Sexual Reproduction:
    - Egg and sperm fertilize to become a zygote
        - Involves meiotic cell division
            - 1 diploid cell divides twice to produce 4 genetically different
              haploid daughter cells (gametes: egg & sperm)
        - Both are "gamete" cells
            - Gametes are produced by organs called gonads
                - Ovary -> eggs
                - Testes -> sperm
            - Gametes are haploid and are produced by meiosis
    - Offspring are genetically different from their parents and siblings

    - Advantages:
        - Genetically diverse offspring (is useful in a changing or
          unpredictable environment)
        - Provides protection against mutation load
            - Definition of mutation load
                - Harmful mutations tend to accumulate over many generations and
                  are passed on to all of the offspring
                - Accumulation of deleterious mutation
        - More ideal during changing, unpredictable conditions or under
          situations when mutation load is a problem

    - Disadvantages:
        - Genetically diverse means passing on a lower proportion of your own
          genes.
        - Resources needed to find a mate.
        - Resources put into creation of sperm and egg (gamete production), but
          most of these will never become zygotes (wasted)

- Asexual Reproduction
    - Some animals can reproduce asexually
    - This will involve mitotic cell division
    - Offspring are genetically identical to their parents or siblings

    - Advantages:
        - Pass on more copies of your genes
        - No resources lost
            - Looking for mates
            - Producing unused gametes
        - Resources can go towards the actual offspring

    - Disadvantages:
        - More ideal during stable, predictable conditions but can be
          problematic over multiple generations due to mutation load
            - Mutation load defined above
        - Offspring are genetically identical, meaning that adverse conditions
          that kill one of them could very likely kill all of them

    - Types of Asexual Reproduction
        - Budding
            - A new individual sprouts from the body of another using mitosis
                - Porifera and Cnidaria

        - Fragmentation (or "Fission")
            - When one individual splits its body into two or more pieces of
              approximately the same size
                - Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, and Echinodermata

        - Parthenogenesis
            - When a female produces eggs through mitosis instead of meiosis
            - These eggs do not need to be fertilized to undergo embryonic
              development
                - Occurs in a variety of phyla, including Arthropoda and
                  Chordata
            - Types of Parthenogenesis
                - Haploid
                    - Unfertilized haploid egg develops without being
                      fertilized (this would've been diploid had they of been);
                      not completely asexual because meiosis is involved even
                      though fertilization is not
                    - Develops into haploid individual
                    - e.g., male bees, wasps, and ants

                - Diploid
                    - Apomictic
                        - Females produce diploid eggs through mitosis which
                          develop into clones of the mother; clearly asexual
                        - Develops into diploid individual
                        - e.g. aphids, daphnia

                    - Automictic
                        - Females produce haploid eggs that get fertilized by
                          other oocytes or polar bodies
                        - Develops into diploid individual
                        - e.g. some lizards

                - During spermatogenesis, each diploid “primary spermatocyte”

                - During oogenesis, each diploid “primary oocyte”
                  produces only one haploid mature “ovum” and three
                  haploid “polar bodies”

        - Low number because they take high amounts of resources to make
            - Stationary

Fertilization
    - Sperm use a chemical gradient to locate an egg (chemoattraction)
    - Sperm binds to the outer layer of the egg
    - Acrosomes release their contents and the flagellum increases its activity
      to help the sperm penetrate to the cell membrane of the egg
    - When the sperm contacts the cell membrane of the egg:
        - The cell membranes of the sperm and the egg cell merge, allowing the
          sperm nucleus to enter the egg
        - Calcium ions inside the egg are used to generate a low voltage signal
          (called an “action potential”) that rapidly travels over the surface
          of the egg
        - The action potential induces “cortical granules” near the surface of
          the egg to release their contents via exocytosis
        - The chemicals released break down sperm receptors on the outside
          surface of the egg’s cell membrane and induce the vitelline envelope
          to separate from the cell membrane and change into a denser
          “fertilization envelope”
    - The fertilization envelope prevents multiple sperm from fertilizing the
      egg (i.e. it prevents “polyspermy”)
