Bones:
    Terms:
        - Articulation: a point in which bones make contact
        - Condyles: smooth, rounded bulges, site of articulation
        - Fossae: indented area for articulation, to provide room for muscle
        - Process: bumps or ridges, sites of muscle attachments
        - Foramina: holes for nerves, blood vessels

    - Head:
        - Frontal: forehead region
        - Temporal: above the ear
        - Parietal: upper back of the head
        - Occipital: bottom back of the head
        - Lacrimal: tear duct region
        - Mandible: jaw bone
        - Maxilla: bone upper teeth are attached to

    - Shoulder:
        - Scapula: shoulder bone

    - Arm:
        - Humerus: Upper arm that connects to shoulder socket and ulna
        - Ulna: (wrench) connects to humerus, pairs with the radius
        - Radius: makes up the wrist bone and pairs with the ulna

    - Leg:
        - Femur: leg bone that connects hip to knee
        - Tibia: larger weight-bearing bone that attaches to femur and runs down
                 to the ankle, pairs with the fibula
        - Fibula: smaller bone that pairs with the tibia

    - Hip:
        - Ilium: uppermost largest part of the hip bone
        - Ischium: the curved bone forming the base of each half of the pelvis
        - Pubis: two bones (on the left and right side) that connect to the
                 pubic symphysis (lower center pelvic bone)

    - Mouth:
        - Teeth:
            - Incisors: Snipping (scissor-like) teeth (front row for humans)
            - Canines: Pointer teeth in front left and right (dog-like)
            - Pre-molars: Between canines and molars, look like molars
            - Molars: Very back teeth, used for grinding and mashing

            - Classifications based on types of teeth:
                - Homodont: Teeth are of one type
                    - if all incisors, likely a carnivore
                    - if all molars, likely a herbivore

                - Heterodont: Teeth can be a variety of types
                    - indicates a variety of diets

        - Diastema: gap in the mouths of herbivores

    - Vertebrae (top-down order)
        - Cervical: neck region
            - Atlas: holds up the head (Atlas "holds the globe")
            - Axis: next bone that allows rotation of the head
        - Thoracic: chest region
        - Lumber: lower back region
        - Sacral: hip area
        - Caudal: tail bone in species that have tails
