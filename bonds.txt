Weakest to Strongest:

    Hydrogen:
        - ?
        - When molecules have polar covalent bonds, shared electrons spend more
          time near one atom than the other, which results in poles. These poles
          are charged and attract other polar molecules.
    Ionic:
        - Salts
        - One atom gives another one an electron.  One atom now has a positive
          charge while the other one has a negative charge.  They are now a
          attracted to each other.
    Covalent:
        - Molecules
        - Bond held by the sharing of electrons
