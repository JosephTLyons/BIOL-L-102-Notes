    - Generalized Plant Phylogeny:
        - Water Plants:
            - Green Algae (produce 1/2 oxygen in the atmosphere)

        - Embryophytes: Informally - LAND PLANTS
            - Def
                - Members of this kingdom can also be called “embryophytes”
                  because the embryos are retained within the parent during
                  their early embryonic stages
            - Mosses (Bryophytes)
            - Tracheophytes: Vascular Plants
                - "Tracheophyte" means its a plant with tracheid cells (see
                  tracheid section)
                - Ferns
                - Gymnosperms
                - Angiosperms (flowering plants)
                    - Most disperse flowering plants

    - Other Classification
        - Seedless Non-Vascular:
            - Ex: Mosses
        - Seedless Vascular:
            - Ex: Ferns
        - Seed-bearing Vascular
            - Gymnosperms
                - Uncovered / "Naked" Seed
                - Seeds are usually configured as cones
                - Ex: Conifers
                    - Spruce
                    - Pine
                    - Secoya
            - Angiosperms
                - Covered Seed
                    - Closed within an ovary (usually a fruit)
                - Ex. Flowering Plants, Monocots, Dicots

    - Organ Systems (see plant-anatomy.png)
        - Shoots (above ground usually)
            - Stems (Organ)
                - Definition:
                    - The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes.
                    - The central "shaft"
                - Nodes
                    - The place in which a bud, leaf, twig, or branch is
                      attached to the main portion of the plant
                        - Bud
                            - Meristematic tissue left behind by apical
                              meristem to help leaves grow.
                    - A node is responsible for the growth contained in a bud
                    - Ex: On a potato, the "eyes" are nodes; its where the
                      sprouting begins (what is sprouting here though?)
                - Internodes
                    - Main portion of the plant between nodes (between nodes)
            - Leaves (Organ)
                - Functions
                    - Photosynthesis
                    - Sexual reproduction (often helped by symbiotic fungi)
                - Consists of
                    - Blade
                        - The large flat portion
                    - Petiole
                        - The stem holding the blade on

        - Roots (below ground usually)
            - Organ is the Root
            - Has a root cap to protect the apical meristems at the root tips

            - Root Types
                - Taproot (dicot)
                    - Single, main root, with branching
                - Fibrous Root (monocot)
                    - Many similarly sized roots growing from base of stem

            - Function
                - Uptake of water and mineral nutrients
                - Anchor the plant in the soil
                - Storage of sugars

    - Plant Cells and Tissues
        - 4 tissues
            - Epidermal
                - Outer layer of of cells
                * protection
                * reduces water loss
                - allows gas exchange
                - In above-ground parts of terrestrial plants, covered with
                  cuticle (wax = cutin)
            - Vascular
                - Conducts water, minerals, sugars throughout the plant body
                - Provides support
            - Ground
                * Photosynthesis
                * Storage
                * Support
            - Meristematic
                * Responsible for new growth, site of mitosis

    - 3 Types of Cells
        1) Epidermal cells
        2) Guard cells
            - open and close stomata
                - Stomate: Open during day, closed at night to retain water
                    - On bottom of leaf
        3) Trichome cells
            - small hair-like structures on the plant

    - Vascular - tubes in plant
        - Xylem
            - Conducts (moves) water
            - Usually bigger
            - Moves contents only up
            - Tracheid Cells
                * in all vascular plants
                - Cell that helps in the transportation of water
                - Dead functional cells
            - Vessel elements
                * Angiosperms (which are tracheophytes)
        - Phloem
            - Conducts (moves) food (sugar)
            - Usually smaller
            - Moves contents both up and down
            - Sieve
                - Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars
                  over long distance through plants by acting as a channel.
                  Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their
                  walls.
            - Companion Cells
                - Load sugars
                - Provides help to sieve tubes
                - Mnemonic
                    - "Companions help you with food"
                    - Can deduce that food = phloem
    - Meristems
        - Produce primary growth
            - Growth is indeterminate
        - Similar to stem cells in humans
        - Forever embryonic cells (?)
        - Kinds
            - Apical
                - Apical comes from the root "Apex"
                - Vertical growth upwards and downwards
            - Lateral
                - Width growth (wood and bark)

    - Compound Leaves
        - Leaflets
            - Each of the leaflike structures that together make up a compound
              leaf
            * Do not have axillary buds
                - One of the ways to know a leaf is actually a leaflet belonging
                  to a complex leaf.
        - Doubly compound leaves
            - Compound leaves coming off of compound leaves

    - Venation Terms
        - Pinnate (Dicot)
            - Coming off in various places on a central "shaft"
        - Palmate (Dicot)
            - Leaves radiating outward from a central location
        - Parallel (Monocot)
            - Running in the same, one direction

    - Leaf Arrangement Terms
        - Opposite
            - Grow opposite of each other, across the petiole extension (rachis)
        - Alternate
            - Grow alternatively on either side of the petiole extension
              (rachis)
        - Whorled
            - Grow around the petiole extension (rachis)

        - Some of the venation terms are also used in leaf arrangement
            - Pinnate
            - Palmate

    - Sheath (only in monocots)
        - The tubular portion of the leaf which wraps around or encloses the
          stem
    - Stipule
        - One of a pair of lateral appendages, often leaf-like, at the base of a
          leaf petiole in many plants.

    - Monocot vs Dicot
        - Monocot
            - One cotyledon in seed
                - Cotyledon: An embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants

        - Dicot
            - Stems are capable of lateral growth
            - Two cotyledon in seed
            - Vascular bundles in a distinct ring
            - Venation:
                - Leaf veins form a net pattern
            - Flower parts in 4s / 5s or multiples of 4s / 5s
            - Ex:
                - Flowering plants
                - Cacti
                    - Have Taproots -> Dicot
                        - Recall that fibrous roots are typical of monocots
        - See monocot-vs-dicot-(root || stem).jpg

    - Modified Stems
        - Stolons (runners)
            - Definition

          of water, to keep the plant's surface area at a minimum to preserve
          water from evaporation in the sun.
