    ==============================IMPORTANT TERMS===============================
    - Restriction enzymes
        - Cut DNA at specific recognition sites
        - Fragment count = recognition sites + 1
            - Ex: 5 cuts => 6 fragments
    - Ligases
        - Glue DNA
            - Must be blunt pieces with compatible ends (sticky ends)
    ? Polymerases
        - Synthesize DNA/RNA
    - Cloning Vectors
        - An autonomously replicating genetic element used to carry DNA into a
          host cell for the purpose of gene cloning
    ? Transformation
        - The genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the direct uptake and
          incorporation of exogenous genetic material from its surroundings
          through the cell membrane(s).
    ? Electrophoresis-size fractionation
        - Small molecules travel faster (further)
        - Large molecules move slower (not as far)
    - Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
        - A planar molecule that intercalates (inserts) between DNA base pairs
            - Binds between the base pairs pairs
        - IS A CARCINOGEN
        - It fluoresces orange when excited with ultraviolet light
            - UV CAN BURN YOUR EYES!

    - Making new DNA usually involves:
        1) Cutting DNA (restriction enzyme)
        2) Pasting DNA (Ligase)
        3) Making many copies and clones (Cloning Vector)

    - Electrophoresis
        - Separation technology
        - Molecules move with electric current
        - Electrophoresis-size fractionation
            - Small molecules go fast, large molecules go slow
        - DNA is negatively charged
            - Moves from the negative side to the positive side
        - Gel Agarose
            - Provides the mesh that the DNA must travel through when pulled
              towards the positive side
        - Ladder (Standard Size)
            - Pre cut DNA with known number of base pairs per fragment that we
              can use to as a "ruler" for the DNA we are actually testing.
            - Brightest glowing pair on ladder usually is some specific size of
              base pairs (300 or 500 base pairs)
        - Lambda phage
            - We usually have one uncut lambda and then the lambda cut with the
              unknown enzymes
