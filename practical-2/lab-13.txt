    - Alternations of Generations
        - Gametophyte (1N) -> Sporophyte  (2N)
        - Sporophyte  (2N) -> Gametophyte (1N)

    - Flower Structure
        - Pedicel
            - A small stalk bearing an individual flower.
            - The main support piece
        - Petal
            -
        - Sepal
            - Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the
              flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom
        - Receptacle
            - In angiosperms, the receptacle is the thickened part of a stem
              (pedicel) from which the flower organs grow.
            - In some accessory fruits, for example the pome and strawberry, the
              receptacle gives rise to the edible part of the fruit.
        - Ovule
            - The part of the ovary of seed plants that contains the female germ
              cell and after fertilization becomes the seed
        - Corolla
            - Outermost ring of petals
        - Calyx
            - Middle ring of petals
        - Reproduction Organs
            - Male
                - Stamen
                    - Anthers (microsporangia)
                        - HONEY SMACKS!
                        - Pollen comes from here
                    - Filament
                        - HOLDS THE HONEY SMACKS!
            - Female
                - Pistil (or Carpel)
                    - Stigma
                        - Funnels the pollen down a "pollen tube," through the
                          style portion of the pistil, and directly into the
                          ovary.
                    - Style
                    - Ovary
            - Perfect
                - Individual flower has both stamens AND carpels
            - Imperfect
                - Individual flower has stamens OR carpels
