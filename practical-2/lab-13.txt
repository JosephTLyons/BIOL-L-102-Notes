    - Alternations of Generations
        - Gametophyte (1N) -> Sporophyte  (2N)
        - Sporophyte  (2N) -> Gametophyte (1N)

        - Mnemonic
            - 1 O  in gametophyte = 1N
            - 2 Os in sporophyte  = 2N

        - Gametophyte produces gametes
        - Sporophyte  produces spores

    - Flower Structure
        - Pedicel
            - A small stalk bearing an individual flower.
            - The main support piece
        - Petal
            -
        - Sepal
            - Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the
              flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom
        - Receptacle
            - In angiosperms, the receptacle is the thickened part of a stem
              (pedicel) from which the flower organs grow.
            - In some accessory fruits, for example the pome and strawberry, the
              receptacle gives rise to the edible part of the fruit.
        - Corolla
            - Outermost ring of petals
        - Calyx
            - Middle ring of petals
        - Reproduction Organs
            - Male
                - Stamen
                    - Anthers (microsporangia)
                        - HONEY SMACKS!
                        - Pollen comes from here
                    - Filament
                        - HOLDS THE HONEY SMACK!
            - Female
                - Pistil (or Carpel)
                    - Stigma
                        - Funnels the pollen down a "pollen tube," through the
                          style portion of the pistil, and directly into the
                          ovary.
                    - Style
                    - Ovary
                        - Ovule
                            - The part of the ovary of seed plants that contains
                              the female germ cell and after fertilization
                              becomes the seed
                            - Locule
                                - Each of a number of small separate cavities,
                                  especially in an ovary
                        - Classifications
                            - Superior
                                - Ovary is above the places where petals attach
                            - Inferior
                                - Ovary is below the places where petals attach
                            - Half-inferior
                                - Petals attach to the middle of the ovary
            - Perfect
                - Individual flower has both stamens AND carpels
            - Imperfect
                - Individual flower has stamens OR carpels

        - Hypanthium
            - A cuplike or tubular enlargement of the receptacle of a flower,
              loosely surrounding the gynoecium or united with it.


    - Types of Fruits
        - Definition of a Fruit
            - Ripened ovary
        ========
        - Dry
            - Sunflower
            - Hazel
            - Etc.
        - Fleshy
            - Berry
            - Apple
            - Etc.
        ========
        - Dehiscent
            - Are mostly dry
            - At maturity, splits open to reveal seeds
            - "Characterized by splitting or bursting open"
        - Indehiscent
            - Are mostly fleshy
            - Predation, decay releases seeds
            - "Not splitting open to release the seeds when ripe"
        ========
        - Simple Fruit
            - Definition
                - Ripe ovary of a single carpel of a single flower
            - Example
                - Apple
                - Tomato
                - Pea
        - Aggregate Fruit
            - Definition
                - Develops from one flower, many carpels
            - Example
                - Strawberry
                    - Many one-seeded archenes produced by a single flower
                    - Archenes are the bumps on the strawberry
                    - They are remnants of the carpels
                    - The green leaves are the sepals
        - Multiple Fruit
            - Definition
                - Develops from many flowers with many carpels
            - Produced from tightly packed flowers
            - Example
                - Pineapple
                    - Each one of the sectioned-off pieces is an individual and
                      separate fruit
                    - "Multiple fruit develop from many individual flowers on an
                      inflorescence.  As the individual fruit grow, they fuse
                      together."
        ========
        - The last 3 fruit types can also be modified by being an accessory
          fruit
            - Accessory Fruit
                - Ovary wall plus other parts of flower
                    - American Apple (Simple Fruit)
                        - Accessory fruit because it has other parts of the
                          flower, such as
                            - Pedicel
                            - Remnants of the calyx
                    - Strawberry (Aggregate)
                        - Accessory fruit because it has other parts of the
                          flower, such as
                            - Sepal

    - Germination is the process by which an organism grows from a seed or
      similar structure

    - Seeds
        - Cotyledons
            * THESE BECOME THE FIRST LEAVES!
                - Die shortly after
            - 1 in monocots (monocotyledon)
            - 2 in dicots   (dicotyledon)
        - Embryo
        - Food supply
            - Stored in endosperm (monocots only)
            - or cotyledons       (dicots)
        - Endosperm
            - The part of a seed which acts as a food store for the developing
              plant embryo, usually containing starch with protein and other
              nutrients
        - Seed coat (AKA Testa)
            - Offers protection to the seed
        - Radicle
            - Embryonic root
        - Plumule
            - Rudimentary stem / root
    - Fruit and Seed Dispersal
        - Wind-dispersed fruit
        - Water-dispersed fruit
        - Animal-dispersed hitchhiker fruit
        - Animal-dispersed editable fruit
            - Animals eat, then digest, and excrete them in new locations
