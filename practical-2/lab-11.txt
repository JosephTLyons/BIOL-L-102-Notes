    - Know:
        - Chambers (L and R are swapped)
            - Top 2: Atriums
            - Bottom 2: Ventricles
                - Note: Left ventricle is has the biggest wall as it has to pump
                  harder to move blood throughout the body (systemic
                  circulation) then the right ventricle, which only has to move
                  blood to the lungs and back (pulmonary circulation).
                - The pulmonary circulation is, overall, a much lower pressure
                  system than that of systemic circulation.  The systemic
                  circulation has to work against gravity, especially when a
                  person is standing.

        - Vessels

        - Blood Flow
            - Pulmonary Artery -> Lungs
                - Where it carries deoxygenated blood
            - Systemic -> Rest of the Body
                - Aorta
                    - Artery
                    - Systemic loop
                - Where it carries oxygenated blood
                - Must pump harder than pulmonary artery
        - Arteries
            - Def
                - Carries oxygenated blood if going to systemic loop
                - Usually blood travels away from the heart
            - Coronary
                - Some parts of the heart only pump deoxygenated blood, such as
                  the right atrium and right ventricle.  However, the muscles
                  that cause these parts of the heart to pump still need
                  oxygenated blood.  The coronary (artery) carries oxygenated
                  blood to these regions to keep the tissue and muscles living.
                - Oxygen-depleted blood must be carried away. The coronary
                  arteries wrap around the outside of the heart. They send
                  oxygen-rich blood into the heart's muscle tissues.
        - Veins
            -Def
                - Carries deoxygenated blood if going to pulmonary loop
                - Usually blood travels towards the heart
            - Superior Vena Cava
                - Carries deoxygenated blood to the heart from the head, arms,
                  and upper body.
            - Inferior Vena Cava
                - Carries deoxygenated blood to the heart from the legs and
                  lower body.

        - Valves

    - Blood Flow in Humans
        1) Deoxygenated Blood (DB) arrives in the right atrium via the superior
           vena cava (from upper part of the body) and the inferior vena cava
           (from lower part of they body)
        2) The DB is pushed into the right ventricle
        3) The DB is then pushed into the pulmonary artery, which takes blood
           away from the heart and into the left and right lungs (pulmonary
           circulation)
        4) The lungs convert the DB into Oxygenated Blood (OB).
        5) The blood is then pulled into the left atrium from the left and right
           pulmonary veins (pulmonary: lungs, veins: towards the heart)
        6) The OB is pushed into the left ventricle.
        7) The OB is pushed out of the aorta (an artery) and then circulates
           throughout the upper and lower body (systemic circulation).
        8) After circulating the body, the OB blood becomes DB, and it returns
           to the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava.

    - Red:  Oxygenated
    - Blue: Deoxygenated (like characters in cartoons when they hold their
            breath)

    - Open-Heart Systems
        1) Pumps blood out of the system via arteries
        2) Brings blood directly back into the heart through openings in it
        -  Ex:
            - Grasshoppers
    - Closed-Heart Systems (based on birds and mammals system slide)
        1) Pulmonary Circulation: Heart pumps deoxygenated blood to capillaries
           (in humans, this is in the lungs) via the arteries
        2) The capillaries return oxygenated blood to the heart via the veins.
        3) Systemic Circulation: The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood to
           the system (aorta)
        4) The system returns deoxygenated blood to the heart.

        - Blood never leaves the system like it does in an open-heart system

    - Bradycardia
        - Heart beat slows
    - Tachycardia
        - Heart beats quickly
    - Blood pressure
        - Systole (contraction) / Diastole (relaxation)

    ===================================REVIEW===================================
    - Blood pressure
        - Systole (contraction): beating pressure
        - Diastole (relaxation)
        - Ex:
            - Systole / Diastole
            - 120/80
