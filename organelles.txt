Organelles have cell membranes around them, if a structure does not have a cell
member, it is technically not an organelle.

Organelles
    01. Ribosomes: Necessary for building polypeptides (required for proteins)
        - NOT AN ORGANELLE! but a key structure
        - Present in all cells (eukaryotes and prokaryotes)
        - Large and Small subunit made of proteins and rRNA

    02. Nucleus and Related Structures:
        - Nuclear Envelope
            - A double membrane that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from
              the fluid environment of the rest of the cell
        - Nuclear Pores
            - Large holes in the nuclear envelope that allow very large
              structures (e.g., proteins, ribosomes, mRNA) to pass between the
              nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm
        - Nucleoplasm
            - Fluid environment inside the nucleus, consisting primarily of
              “chromatin”
            - Chromatin is the form the chromosomes take when they are
              unspooled, making the genetic information available for protein
              synthesis; chromatin, like chromosomes, is made of DNA and
              histone proteins
        - Nucleolus
            - A region inside the nucleus where ribosomes are made; the
              chromatin of chromosomes with genes for making ribosomes are found
              here

    03. Endoplasmic Reticulum - A network of cell membrane arranged into folds
        and pockets that is an extension of the outer membrane of the nuclear
        envelope; divided into two regions
        - Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
            - Long, parallel folds
            - lots of ribosomes here
            - Major site of peptide synthesis (ribosomes are used to build
              polypeptides)
        - Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
            - Membrane folds are irregular forming circular pockets
            - Major site of lipid synthesis and detoxification

    04. Golgi Apparatus - ?
        - Cisternae - elongated chamber surrounded by single membrane
            - Lumen - interior
            - A tight stack of cisternae make up the golgi apparatus
        - Cis face
            - Faces rough ER of nucleus
            - Vesicles travel from the rough ER to the cis face and assemble to
              form new cisternae, pushing other cisternae down the stack
        - Trans face
            - Faces away from cis face
            - When the cisternae reach the trans face, they disassemble into
              small vesicles that contain finished proteins and carry them to
              where they are needed in the cell
            - Secretory vesicles transport protein from the trans face to the
              outer cell membrane where the contents will be released out of the
              cell via the process called exocytosis.

    05. Centrosomes
        - Not technically an organelle (not surrounded by a membrane)
        - Consists of 2 cylindrical centrioles composed primarily of tubulin
          protein positioned at right angles to each other.
        - Play a role in establishing and organizing microtubule networks in the
          cell cytoskeleton that assist in the movement of objects within the
          cell (especially apparent during cell division)
        - Centrioles also form the “basal bodies” necessary for the formation of
          flagella and cilia

    06. Lysosomes (animal feature)
        - Contain enzymes for hydrolysis reaction (breaking of a bond using
          water molecule - opposite of dehydration reaction) allowing it to
          break down and recycle various macromolecules
        - Internal PH is more acidic than pH of cytoplasm
        - A feature of animal cells

    07. Peroxisomes
        - Contain enzymes that break down fatty acids and other non-polymer
          molecules through oxidation or redox reactions (different from
          condensation or hydrolysis reactions); these reactions produce highly
          reactive products, such as hydrogen peroxide, which would be dangerous
          if they were allowed to enter the cytoplasm; the peroxisome contains
          enzymes that render these reactive products harmless

    08. Vacuoles (plant feature)
        - A large organelle in plant or fungal cells that can serve multiple
          functions
            - maintain pressure inside the cell
            - storage of various compounds
            - the breakdown and recycling of macromolecules (like the lysosomes
              of animal cells)

    09. Mitochondria: "POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL," main site of ATP production and
        is responsible for the aerobic part of cellular respiration
        - Inner and outer membranes (double membrane)
            - Outer member is rounded and smooth and inner member is wrinkled up
              and has folds
        - Intermembrane space
            - Space between inner member and outer membrane
        - Matrix
            - Inner fluid environment
        - Cristae
            - Folds in the inner membrane

    10. Chloroplasts: site of photosynthesis (use for ATP and glucose
        production)
        - Feature of plant cells and some protists
        - Site of photosynthesis (used for ATP and glucose production)
        - Inner and outer membranes (double membrane)
            - Roughly the same shape; rounded
        - Stroma
            - Fluid environment inside the chloroplast
        - Grana
            - Stack of thylakoids
        - Thylakoids
            - Disk-like sac that contains a fluid called "lumen"
