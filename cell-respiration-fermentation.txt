Cellular Respiration (short overview)
- Objective of cellular respiration is to obtain the energy stored in the
  covalent bonds between carbon atoms (glucose specifically in example below)
  and use that energy to convert ADP to ATP.

Energy storage molecules:

    Low energy forms    High energy forms
    -------------------------------------
    NAD              -> NADH
    FAD              -> FADHsub(2)
    ADP              -> ATP

ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate - a nucleotide)
    - Has high potential energy and allows cells to overcome life's energy
      barriers.

Net reaction:

    C6-H12-O2 + 6 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H20 + ATP (many)
    (glucose)

        Broken down into 2 sub-reactions:

        1) C6-H12-O2 -> 6 CO2             |  2) 6 O2        -> 6 H20
           ----------||-----------        |     ------------||-----------
           ADP       -> ATP (some)        |     ADP         -> ATP (lots)
           NAD       -> NADH              | ->  NADH        -> NAD
           FAD       -> FADHsub(2)        | ->  FADHsub(2)  -> FAD
                                          |
        C-C-C-C-C-C  -> C02-CO2-C02-CO2-  |  NOTE: Most ATP production happens
                        C02-CO2           |  here in 2nd sub-reaction
                                          |
                                          |
        Every time covalent bonds break,  |
        as in breaking them in glucose    |
        above, energy is created.  Which  |
        is why high energy forms of each  |
        item is created.                  |

Full Cellular Respiration Process (aerobic - when oxygen is present):

1) Glycolysis (produces some ATP and some NADH)
    - "lysis" - to break apart
    - so Glycolysis means to break apart glucose

    1) One six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon
       molecules called pyruvates.

       C-C-C-C-C-C -> C-C-C and C-C-C
       2 ATP       -> 4 ATP

        - ATP is produced from ADP and Psub(i)
        - NAD is reduced to NADH

2) Oxidative decarboxylation (pyruvate oxidation)
3) Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)
4) Oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain, chemiosmosis)

Net reaction:
C6-H12-O2 + 6 O2 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H20 + ATP (many)
