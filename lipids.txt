Lipids:
========================== Building Blocks Below ===========================
- Monomers:
    1. fatty acids
        - long chains of hydrocarbons + carbonyl group
        - mostly non-polar (hydrophobic), but are considered amphipathic
          because their carbon end is non-polar and their carbonyl end is
          polar
        - Saturated
            - all single bonds linking carbons
            - not kinked
            - "saturated" refers to the Hydrogen atoms.  With all single
              bonds, we can have more hydrogen atoms (saturated hydrogen)
            - can pack tightly
            - behave like a solid at room temperature
        - Unsaturated
            - have at least one double bond between carbon atoms
            - are kinked
            - pack more loosely
            - behave like a liquid at room temperature
        - trans fats
            - has double bond, but is linear, not kinked
    2. glycerol
- Steroids
    - hydrocarbon ring structure (hippopotamus)
        - 4 rings
            - 3 6-sided
            - 1 5-sided
========================== Building Blocks Above ===========================
- Polymers
    - Triglycerides
        - 1 glycerol + 3 fatty acid chains
        - fatty acid chains attach to glycerol through dehydration reaction
    - Phospholipids
        - 1 glycerol + 2 fatty acid chains + 1 phosphate group
        - fatty acid chains attach to glycerol through dehydration
        - Phospholipid Bilayer
            - The type of fatty acid affects the permeability of the
              membrane
                - saturated = packed, not as permeable
                - unsaturated = kinks and loosely packed, more permeable
