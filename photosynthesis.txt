Photosynthesis
    - The process of converting light energy into chemical energy, allowing CO2
      to be used to build glucose
    - Parallel: things that happen in the chloroplast in photosynthesis are very
      similar to things that happen in the mitochondrion during cell
      respiration.

    1) Light-Dependent Reaction: Light makes ATP and NADPH
    2) Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH convert CO2 into sugar

A plant cell's chloroplast captures light energy and converts it to ATP or
glucose, during this process, O2 is produced and CO2 is consumed.

6 CO2 + 6 H2O -> C6-H12-O6 + 6 O2 + ATP
                 (glucose)

This process produces oxygen as a waste product.

================================================================================

The overall process of photosynthesis consists of 2 key steps:

1)  6 H2O -> 6 O2                    | 6 CO2 -> C6-H12-O6

Light Dependent Reaction
    - SEE: images/light-dependent-reaction.jpg (dual screen)
    - Occurs in thylakoid of the chloroplast
        - Recall that a granum is a stack of thylakoids (disk-like sacs)

    - Procedure
        - Input:
            - H20 (electron donor)
        - Output:
            - ATP and NADPH (used to power Calvin Cycle)
            - O2 (waste)

        - H2O is the donor molecule.  It donates a pair of electrons to PS II.
            - The remaining 2 H^+ ions is used during the chemiosmosis step
        - PS II capture light energy (photons) and uses it to charge the
          electrons
        - PS II passes these high energy electrons to plastoquinone.
        - Plastoquinone passes to the electron transport chain (Cytochrome
          Complex), which pumps 4 H^+ ions into the thylakoid's lumen from the
          stroma.
        - The electron transport chain passes the electrons to plastocyanin,
          which passes them to PS I, where again, light energy (photons)
          transform them into high energy electrons (recharge them).
        - PS 1 passes these electrons to Ferredoxin
        - Ferredoxin passes the electrons to NADP^+ Reductase, which uses them
          to link NADP^+ with a H^+ in order to reduce NADP^+ to NAPDPH
        - This newly created NADPH goes to the Calvin cycle, while the H^+ ions
          create a higher [H^+] inside the thylakoid lumen that drives ATP
          synthase, linking together ADP + Psub(i) to make ATP, which flows back
          into the stroma.
        - This ATP also moves onto the Calvin cycle
        - Remember, O2 is released as a byproduct to this process.

        * Essentially
            - PS II: Uses light energy to generate a [H^+] gradient, which
              creates ATP.
            - PS I: Uses light energy to convert NADP into NADPH

    - Photosystem Details:
        - Made of proteins and pigments (chlorophyll)
            - 2 L's MATTERS!
        - Consists of:
            1) Antenna Complex
                - Made of Chlorophyll
                    - Has Magnesium atom in its center

                                    -

                    - Amphipathic:
                        - Having both a polar and a non-polar end

                    - Purpose:
                        - Is the main tool that funnels the light energy into
                          the reaction center.
                            - "When pigments in the antenna complex absorbs
                              photons, the energy - but not the electron itself
                              - is passed to a nearby chlorophyll molecule,
                              where another electron is excited"
                                - This is similar to "the wave" at a sports
                                  event
                        - Sticks into the phospholipid bilayer like a stake
                            - This works well because the PB has fatty acid
                              chains that are hydrocarbon chains, so the chain
                              on the chlorophyll is accepted easily.
                    - Chlorophyll is green because that is the color it isn't
                      absorbing, it is absorbing red and blue

                - Collects light energy and funnels it to the reaction center
            2) Reaction Center
                - Takes energy from the antenna complex and generates high
                  energy electrons.

Calvin Cycle
    - SEE: images/calvin_cycle.jpg (dual screen)

    - Takes place in the stroma
        - Parallel to Krebs cycle in the matrix or mitochondrion
        - Main objective is to build larger molecules from CO2
            - To do this, it requires energy in the form of ATP and NADPH
                - These are generated from the light dependent reaction
            - Converts ATP and NADPH into C-C covalent bonds

    - Procedure
        - Input:
            - ATP and NADPH (from light-dependent reaction)
        - Output:
            - C6-H12-O6 (assembled from CO2 using the ATP and NADPH)

    - The Calvin Cycle:
        - Key:
            - RuBP    = Ribulose Bisphosphate (5 carbon molecule)
                        It is the substrate that RuBisCo uses to fixed Carbon
                        Dioxide to.
            - RuBisCo = Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase
                        Most abundant enzyme in the world, used in Fixation step
                        to fix CO2 to RuBP
            - 3PGA    = Phosphoglycerate (3 carbon molecule)
                        This is technically a 3 carbon carbohydrate sugar
            - G3P     = Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (3 carbon molecule)

	    1) Fixation
            - Taking Ribulose Bisphosphate and adding a single carbon dioxide
              molecule to it, using the enzyme RuBisCo to catalyze the reaction.
            - Result: a 6-carbon molecule that immediately breaks in half to
              generate two phosphoglycerates
                - The difference between a glycerol and a -glycerate is that a
                  -glycerate has a carboxyl group (COOH) attached to it.

        2) Reduction (USES NADPH and ATP - Quiz 9: Q 8, 9)
            - The 2 phosphoglycerates are phosphorylated by ATP and
              reduced by NADPH (passes its electrons to 3PGA) to make
              glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
                - Glycer(aldehyde) because carbonyl group at terminal end
                - G3P is a phosphorylated 3-carbon sugar (a carbohydrate)

        ========================================================================
        Note: Steps 1 and 2 occur three times, using 3 RuBisCo, before step 3
              occurs.  Then, step 3 regenerates 3 RuBisCo
        ========================================================================
        3) Regeneration (USES ATP - Quiz 9: Q 8, 9)
            - We have 6 of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphates
                - 1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is used for glucose production,
                  or production of other molecules
                - 5 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphates
                    - Total of 15 carbons
                    - Gets converted to 3 RuBP (NOT RUBISCO), to be used again
                        - This part consumes ATP

        In total:
            - [Steps 1 and 2 occur 3x, step 3 occurs 1x] <- whole process 2x
                - Calvin Cycle 6x to make 1 glucose and regenerate 6 more RuBP
                  to power the cycle again.
