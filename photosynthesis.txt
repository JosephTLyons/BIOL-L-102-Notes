Photosynthesis
    - the process of converting light energy into chemical energy, allowing CO2
      to be used to build glucose
    - Parallel: things that happen in the chloroplast in photosynthesis are very
      similar to things that happen in the mitochondrion during cell
      respiration.

A plant cell's chloroplast captures light energy and converts it to ATP or
glucose, during this process, O2 is produced and CO2 is consumed.

          Light Energy

               v
6 CO2 + 6 H2O -> C6-H12-O6 + 6 O2 + ATP
                 (glucose)

This process produces oxygen as a waste product.

================================================================================

The overall process of photosynthesis consists of 2 key steps:

1)  6 H2O -> 6 O2                    | 6 CO2 -> C6-H12-O6

Light Dependent Reaction
    - Summary:
        - SEE: images/light-dependent-reaction.jpg (dual screen)
        - Occurs in thylakoid of the chloroplast
            - Recall that a granum is a stack of thylakoids (disk-like sacs)

    - Procedure (input: H20 (electron donor), output: O2 (waste))
        - H2O is the donor molecule.  It donates a pair of electrons to PS II.
            - The remaining 2 H^+ ions is used during the chemiosmosis step
        - PS II capture light energy (photons) and uses it to charge the
          electrons
        - PS II passes these high energy electrons to plastoquinone.
        - Plastoquinone passes to the electron transport chain (Cytochrome
          Complex), which pumps 4 H^+ ions into the thylakoid's lumen from the
          stroma.
        - The electron transport chain passes the electrons to plastocyanin,
          which passes them to PS I, where again, light energy (photons)
          transform them into high energy electrons (recharge them).
        - PS 1 passes these electrons to Ferredoxin
        - Ferredoxin passes the electrons to NADP^+ Reductase, which uses them
          to link NADP^+ with a H^+ in order to reduce NADP^+ to NAPDPH
        - This newly created NADPH goes to the Calvin cycle, while the H^+ ions
          create a higher [H^+] inside the thylakoid lumen that drives ATP
          synthase, linking together ADP + Psub(i) to make ATP, which flows back
          into the stroma.
        - This ATP also moves onto the Calvin cycle
        - Remember, O2 is released as a byproduct to this process.

            - 2 L's MATTERS!
        - Consists of:
            1) Antenna Complex

                    - Amphipathic:
                        - Having both a polar and a non-polar end

                    - Purpose:
                        - Sticks into the phospholipid bilayer like a stake

                - Collects light energy and funnels it to the reaction center
            2) Reaction Center
                - Takes energy from the antenna complex and generates high
                  energy electrons.


The Calvin Cycle can be divided into 3 steps:
	1) Fixation
    2) Reduction
    3) Regeneration
