Photosynthesis

A plant cell's chloroplast captures light energy and converts it to ATP or
glucose, during this process, O2 is produced and CO2 is consumed.

6 CO2 + 6 H2O -> C6-H12-O6 + 6 O2

This process produces oxygen as a waste product.

The overall process of photosynthesis consists of 2 key steps:
    1) Light-Dependent Reaction (aka Light Reaction, Z-scheme)
        6 H2O -> 6 O2
    2) Light-Independent Reaction (aka Calvin Cycle, Dark Reaction)
        6 CO2 -> C6-H12-O6

The Calvin Cycle can be divided into 3 steps:
	1) Fixation
    2) Reduction
    3) Regeneration
