Nucleic Acids:
    - Monomer: nucleotides
        - Images on page 16 of notes
        - Ribose (5 carbon sugar) + phosphate group on carbon 5 + nitrogenous
          base on carbon 1
        - Phosphate group is attached to carbon 5
        - 5 kinds organized into 2 categories:
            - Pyrimidines (nitrogenous base has 1 ring structure):
                - Cytosine
                - Uracil
                - Thymine
            - Purines (nitrogenous base has 2 ring structure)
                - Guanine
                - Adenine
        - The Pyrimidines always link to purines
        - Use image on slide 18 or lecture 5 for 5 prime and 3 prime material
        - Use images in slides 20 and 21 of lecture 5 for how the links between
          pyrimidines and purines form the bonds that help to create RNA or DNA

    - Polymer: DNA or RNA
        - Ribose monomers linked together at carbon 3 of the ribose and the
          phosphate group of the next nucleotide
        - When linked, they form Ribonucleic Acid
        - If the OH hydroxyl group on carbon 2 is removed and we only have an H,
          we get DNA
        - Deoxy-Ribonucleic Acid
            - Consists of two polynucleotide chains with corresponding
              nucleotides, linked together via hydrogen bonds between base
              pairs; these linked chains naturally take on a twisted shape
              called a double helix (slide 21 lecture 5)
        - Ribonucleic Acid
            - Consists of a single polynucleotide chain that can fold in upon
              itself through base pair matching between different parts of the
              strand; this generates stem and loop structures (slide 21 lecture
              6)
