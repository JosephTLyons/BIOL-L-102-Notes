Nucleic Acids:
    - Monomer: nucleotides
        - Images on page 16 of notes
        - Ribose (5 carbon sugar) + phosphate group on carbon 5 + nitrogenous
          base on carbon 1
        - Phosphate group is attached to carbon 5
        - Nitrogenous base on carbon 1
            -5 kinds organized into 2 categories:
                - Pyrimidines (1 ring structure):
                    - Cytosine
                    - Uracil
                    - Thymine
                - Purines (2 ring structure)
                    - Guanine (pairs with Cytosine (both RNA and DNA))
                    - Adenine (pairs with Thymine (DNA) or Uracil (RNA))
                - Pyrimidines always link to Purines
                - Thymine is only in DNA
                - Uracil is only in RNA
        - Use image on slide 18 or lecture 5 for 5 prime and 3 prime material
        - Use images in slides 20 and 21 of lecture 5 for how the links between
          pyrimidines and purines form the bonds that help to create RNA or DNA

    - Polymer: DNA or RNA
        - Ribose monomers linked together at carbon 3 of the ribose and the
          phosphate group of the next nucleotide
        - When linked, they form Ribonucleic Acid
        - If the OH hydroxyl group on carbon 2 is removed and we only have an H,
          we get DNA
        - Deoxy-Ribonucleic Acid
            - Consists of two polynucleotide chains with corresponding
              nucleotides, linked together via hydrogen bonds between base
              pairs; these linked chains naturally take on a twisted shape
              called a double helix (slide 21 lecture 5)
            - Structure
                - Primary
                    - Nitrogenous base sequence consisting of A, T, G, C
                - Secondary
                    - 2 antiparallel strands twisted into a double helix
                    - Hydrogen bonds between complimentary nitrogenous bases
                - Tertiary
                    - generally none
        - Ribonucleic Acid
            - Consists of a single polynucleotide chain that can fold in upon
              itself through base pair matching between different parts of the
              strand; this generates stem and loop structures (slide 21 lecture
              6)
            - Structure
                - Primary
                    - Nitrogenous base sequence consisting of A, U, G, C
                - Secondary
                    - Single strand that can fold back on itself to form "loops"
                      with short double helix "stems"
                    - Loops are held together with hydrogen bonds
                - Tertiary
                    - Folds form distinctive 3D shape
        - The nucleic acid strand that is in both RNA and DNA has a
          sugar-phosphate backbone
