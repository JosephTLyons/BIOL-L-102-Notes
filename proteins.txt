Proteins:
    - Monomer: amino acids
        - Know basic shared structure
        - Know 20 different names, polar / non-polar, acidic, or basic
          (amino-acids.txt)
    - Polymer of amino acids = polypeptide
        - The amine group of one amino and the carboxyl group other another
          amino attach to one another through dehydration reaction.  This is a
          peptide bond
        - proteins consist of one of more polypeptide chains
            - polypeptides that fold into a fixed structure are proteins
    - Enzymes: just one type of protein
        - Act as chemical catalysts that speed up reactions that support life
        - Active site = region where other molecules called "substrates" can fit
          in and interact with the surface of the protein
    - Folding
        - primary structure
            - determined by the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein
            - influences higher levels of structure
            - bond: dehydration reaction between carboxyl group and amino group
              results in as strong covalent bond between carbon and nitrogen
              called a peptide bond.
        - secondary structure
            - alpha helices (strands run in same direction)
            - beta sheets (strands run in opposite direction)
            - Which type of fold occurs depends on the amino acid sequence
            - bond: hydrogen bond between the amino group of one amino acid and
              the carboxyl group of another amino acid of the polypeptide chain
        - tertiary structure
            - Overall 3D shape of protein
            - shape is determined by interactions between R-groups and other
              R-groups
            - shape is also determined by interactions between R-groups and
              molecules in the surrounding environment (pH and temperature)
                - Ex. hydrophobic R-groups might face outward and hydrophilic
                  R-groups might face inward.
            - bonds: hydrogen and more
        - quaternary structure
            - arrangement of one or more polypeptide chains grouping together to
              form a protein
            - bonds: hydrogen and more
    - The function of a protein depends on its shape
    - The shape of a protein depends upon the sequence of amino acids in its
      polypeptide chains
