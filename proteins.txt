Proteins:
    - Monomer: amino acids
        - Know basic shared structure
        - Know 20 different names, polar / non-polar, acidic, or basic
          (amino-acids.txt)
    - Polymer of amino acids = polypeptide
        - The amine group of one amino and the carboxyl group other another
          amino attach to one another through dehydration reaction.  This is a
          polypeptide bond
        - proteins consist of one of more polypeptides
            - polypeptides that fold into a fixed structure are proteins
    - Enzymes: just one type of protein
        - Act as chemical catalysts that speed up reactions that support life
        - Active site = region where other molecules called "substrates" can fit
          in and interact with the surface of the protein
    - The function of a protein depends on its shape
    - The shape of a protein depends upon the sequence of amino acids in its
      polypeptide chains
