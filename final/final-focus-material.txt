- Lecture 21
    - Leaves / Endophyte Diversity

    - Inside a plant, the apoplast is the space outside the plasma membrane
      within which material can diffuse freely. It is interrupted by the
      Casparian strip in roots, by air spaces between plant cells and by the
      plant cuticle.

- Lecture 22
    - Mosses (Bryophytes)
        - Gametophyte (1N) is the dominant stage b/c (it is simple)
