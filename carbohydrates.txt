Carbohydrates:
    - Monomer: monosaccharide ("one sugar")
        - Formula: Cn-H2n-On
            Example: C6-H12-O6
        - One carbon group has carbonyl group, all other carbons have hydroxyl
          group
        - Must have both of the previous bullet points to be a carbohydrate
        - Isomer = same molecular formula but different structural arrangement
            - Need to see a diagram to see the difference (see images on page 14
              of notes)
        - Names based on number of carbons (examples):
            - C3-H6-O3 (glyceraldehyde): Triose
            - C5-H10-O5 (Ribose): Pentose
            - C6-H12-O6 (glucose, fructose, galactose): Hexose
                - These are the 3 most common sugars and all have same formula
                  (isomers)
                - glucose can form linearly, but it can bend to become a
                  ring-structure.
                    - ring structures (refer to pictures in notes page 15)
                        - alpha Glucose
                            - same direction
                            - easy to break apart via hydrolysis reaction
                            - starch (still a carbohydrate)
                                - amylose: plant starch
                                - glycogen: animal starch ("-gen" = able to
                                  generate something (glucose))
                        - beta glucose
                            - different direction
                            - very difficult to break bonds, hard to digest
                            - good for building structures
                            - often used for building cell walls (plant)
                            - examples:
                                - cellulose: main component of wood (plants)
                                - chitin (fungi / insect exoskeletons)
                                - peptidoglycans (bacteria: outer layer)
        - Names based on where the double bond:
            - Ketoses
                - carbonyl on internal carbon
            - Aldoses
                - carbonyl on terminal carbon
    - Polymer: polysaccharide ("many sugars")
        - disaccharide (dimer): (2 monomers linked by dehydration reaction)
            - sucrose (table sugar) = glucose + fructose
            - maltose = glucose + glucose
            - lactose = glucose + galactose
            - note: linking carbohydrates through dehydration reaction will
              result in losing an H20, so the structural formula C6-H12-O6 will
              no longer apply
