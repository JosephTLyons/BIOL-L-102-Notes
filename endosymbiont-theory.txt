Mitochondria and Chloroplasts have several key structural similarities that they
share with bacteria

These similarities are the basis of the ENDOSYMBIONT THEORY, which is the idea
that mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many other organelles may have evolved from
bacteria that had been taken into eukaryotic cells at some point in the past.
Thus, according to the endosymbiont theory, eukaryotic cells evolved from the
merging together of multiple prokaryotic cells.

Main Idea:
    - Bacteria merges into a plant or animal cell and overtime, begins to
      develop into organelles

Evidence of Endosymbiotic Origin of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
    - Double membrane
    - Similar in size to bacteria
    - Replicate by fission (like bacteria), independently of cell division
    - Have their own genome, consisting of a ring of DNA (but smaller than a
      typical bacterial genome)
    - Have their own ribosomes, similar to bacterial ribosomes
    - Inner membrane of mitochondria has a molecule (CARDIOLIPIN) that is found
      in bacterial membranes (but not eukaryotic membranes)
        - Cardiolipin: 2 phospholipids connected by a glycerol
    - Chloroplasts in some algae and mosses have an outer layer of
      peptidoglycans

Evolutionary Origin of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
    - Mitochondria are genetically similar to a group of bacteria
      (Î±-proteobacteria) that commonly form symbiotic or parasitic relationships
      with eukaryotes
    - Chloroplasts are genetically similar to a very ancient group of
      photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria)
