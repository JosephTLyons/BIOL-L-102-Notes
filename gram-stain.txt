Gram Staining (identifying different kinds of cell wall)
    1) Get cultures of bacteria
    2) Heat fix cells
    3) Apply crystal violet (purple)
        - stains peptidoglycans (polymers of beta-glucose) of single
          phospholipid bilayer cells and outer layer of cells with two
          phospholipid bilayer
    4) Mordant (iodine) - fixes crystal violet to peptidoglycans, but doesn't
       fix crystal violet to outer layers of cells with two phospholipid
       bilayers
    5) Decolorizer (ethanol) - washes off crystal violet from cells that it is
       not fixed to (the cells with two phospholipid bilayers)
    6) Counterstain with safranin (pink) - stains both, but more so the cells
       with two phospholipid bilayers, and the color isn't as noticeable in the
       cells with peptidoglycan outer layer since it is already stained purple.
    Purple = gram positive
    Pink = gram negative
