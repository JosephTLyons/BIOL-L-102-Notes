            - Gymnosperms
                - Uncovered / "Naked" Seed
                - Seeds are usually configured as cones
                - Ex: Conifers
                    - Spruce
                    - Pine

                    - Closed within an ovary (usually a fruit)
                - Ex. Flowering Plants, Monocots, Dicots

    - Organ Systems (see plant-anatomy.png)
        - Shoots (above ground usually)
            - Stems (Organ)
                - Definition: Near base of plant; support the laves and
                  reproductive structures, and they provide the vascular link
                  to the roots
                - Nodes
                    - The place in which a bud, leaf, twig, or branch is
                      attached to the main portion of the plant
                    - A node is responsible for the growth contained in a bud
                    - Ex: On a potato, the "eyes" are nodes; its where the
                      sprouting begins (what is sprouting here though?)
                - Internodes
                    - Main portion of the plant between nodes (between nodes)
            - Leaves (Organ)
                - Consists of
                    - Blade
                        - The large flat portion
                    - Petiole
                        - The stem holding the blade on

        - Roots (below ground usually)
            - Organ is the Root
            - Has a root cap to protect the apical meristems at the root tips

            - Root Types
                - Taproot (dicot)
                    - Single, main root, with branching
                - Fibrous Root (monocot)
                    - Many similarly sized roots growing from base of stem

            - Function
                - Uptake of water and mineral nutrients
                - Anchor the plant in the soil
                - Storage of sugars

    - Plant Cells and Tissues
        - 3 tissues
            - Epidermal
                - Outer layer of of cells
                - protection
                - reduces water loss
                - allows gas exchange
                - In above-ground parts of terrestrial plants, covered with
                  cuticle (wax = cutin)

            - Vascular
                - Conducts water, minerals, sugars throughout the plant body
                - Provides support
            - Ground
                - Photosynthesis
                - Storage
                - Support

    - 3 Types of Cells
        1) Epidermal cells
        2) Guard cells
            - open and close stomata
                - Stomate: Open during day, closed at night to retain water
                    - On bottom of leaf
        3) Trichome cells
            - small hair-like structures on the plant

    - Vascular - tubes in plant
        - Xylem
            - Conducts (moves) water
            - Usually bigger
            - Moves contents only up
            - Tracheid Cells
                * in all vascular plants
                - Cell that helps in the transportation of water
                - Dead functional cells
            - Vessel elements
                * Angiosperms (which are tracheophytes)
        - Phloem
            - Conducts (moves) food (sugar)
            - Usually smaller
            - Moves contents both up and down
            - Sieve
                - Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars
                  over long distance through plants by acting as a channel.
                  Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their
                  walls.
            - Companion Cells
                - Load sugars
                - Provides help to sieve tubes
                - Mnemonic
                    - "Companions help you with food"
                    - Can deduce that food = phloem
    - Meristems
        - Produce primary growth
            - Growth is indeterminate
        - Similar to stem cells in humans
        - Forever embryonic cells (?)
        - Kinds
            - Apical
                - Apical comes from the root "Apex"
                - Vertical growth upwards and downwards
            - Lateral
                - Width growth (wood and bark)

    - Monocot vs Dicot
        - Monocot
            - One cotyledon in seed
                - Cotyledon: An embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants
            - Vascular bundles scattered in stem
            - Leaf veins parallel
                - Ex: Corn
            - Flower parts in 3s or multiples of 3s
            * Vascular bundle looks like a monkey face!
        - Dicot
            - Two cotyledon in seed
            - Vascular bundles in a distinct ring
            - Leaf veins form a net pattern
            - Flower parts in 4s / 5s or multiples of 4s / 5s
        - See monocot-vs-dicot-(root || stem).jpg

    - Modified Stems
        - Stolons (runners)
            - Horizontal
            - Above Ground
            - Ex:
                - Strawberry, Clover, Bermuda Grass
        - Rhizomes
            - Horizontal
            - Below ground
            - Ex:
                - Ferns, Orchid, Banana, Bamboo, Bluegrass
        - Corm
            - Plant stem that serves as a storage organ
            - Swollen stem base
            - Below ground
                - Ex:
                    - Gladius, Crocus
        - Tuber
            - Enlarged underground stem (rhizome) tip
            - Ex:
                - White potato
        - Bulb
            - Small stem, wrapped in leaves
            - Fleshy leaves
                - Ex:
                    - Onion, Lily, Turnip
