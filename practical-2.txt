Topics Covered

- Lab 10 (6): Molecular Biology

- Lab 11: Cardiac Physiology

- Lab 12: Plant Structure
    - Generalized Plant Phylogeny:
        - Water Plants:
            - Green Algae (produce 1/2 oxygen in the atmosphere)

        - Embryophytes: Informally - LAND PLANTS
            - Mosses
            - Tracheophytes: Vascular Plants
                - Ferns
                - Gymnosperms
                - Angiosperms (flowering plants)

    - Meristems
        - Produce primary growth
        - Similar to stem cells in humans
        - Forever embryonic cells (??)
        - Kinds
            - Apical
                - Apical comes from the root "Apex"
                - Vertical growth upwards and downwards
            - Lateral
                - Width growth (wood and bark)

- Lab 13: Plant Reproduction
