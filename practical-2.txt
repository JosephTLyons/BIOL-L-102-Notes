    - Restriction enzymes
        - Cut DNA at specific recognition sites
        - Fragment count = recognition sites + 1
            - Ex: 5 cuts => 6 fragments
    - Ligases
        - Glue DNA
            - Must be blunt pieces with compatible ends (sticky ends)
    ? Polymerases
        - Synthesize DNA/RNA
    - Cloning Vectors
        - An autonomously replicating genetic element used to carry DNA into a
          host cell for the purpose of gene cloning
    ? Transformation
    ? Electrophoresis-size fractionation
        - Small molecules travel faster (further)
        - Large molecules move slower (not as far)
    - Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
        - A planar molecule that intercalates (inserts) between DNA base pairs
            - Binds between the base pairs pairs
        - IS A CARCINOGEN
        - It fluoresces orange when excited with ultraviolet light
            - UV CAN BURN YOUR EYES!

    - Making new DNA usually involves:
        1) Cutting DNA (restriction enzyme)
        2) Pasting DNA (Ligase)
        3) Making many copies and clones (Cloning Vector)

    - Electrophoresis
        - Separation technology
        - Molecules move with electric current
        - Electrophoresis-size fractionation
            - Small molecules go fast, large molecules go slow
        - DNA is negatively charged
            - Moves from the negative side to the positive side
        - Gel Agarose
            - Provides the mesh that the DNA must travel through when pulled
              towards the positive side
        - Ladder (Standard Size)
            - Pre cut DNA with known number of base pairs per fragment that we
              can use to as a "ruler" for the DNA we are actually testing.
            - Brightest glowing pair on ladder usually is some specific size of
              base pairs (300 or 500 base pairs)
        - Lambda phage
            - We usually have one uncut lambda and then the lambda cut with the
              unknown enzymes

                      attached to the main portion of the plant
                    - A node is responsible for the growth contained in a bud
                    - Ex: On a potato, the "eyes" are nodes; its where the
                      sprouting begins (what is sprouting here though?)
                - Internodes
                    - Main portion of the plant between nodes (between nodes)

                - Storage of sugars

    - Plant Cells and Tissues
        - 3 tissues
            - Epidermal
                - Outer layer of of cells
                - protection
                - reduces water loss
                - allows gas exchange
                - In above-ground parts of terrestrial plants, covered with
                  cuticle (wax = cutin)

            - Vascular
                - Conducts water, minerals, sugars throughout the plant body

        2) Guard cells
            - open and close stomata
                - Stomate: Open during day, closed at night to retain water
                    - On bottom of leaf
        3) Trichome cells
            - small hair-like structures on the plant

    - Vascular - tubes in plant
        - Xylem
            - Conducts (moves) water
            - Usually bigger
            - Moves contents only up
            - Tracheid Cells
                * in all vascular plants
                - Cell that helps in the transportation of water

                - Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars
                  over long distance through plants by acting as a channel.
                  Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their
                  walls.
            - Companion Cells

            - Leaf veins parallel
                - Ex: Corn
            - Flower parts in 3s or multiples of 3s
            * Vascular bundle looks like a monkey face!
        - Dicot
            - Two cotyledon in seed
            - Vascular bundles in a distinct ring
            - Leaf veins form a net pattern

            - Below ground
