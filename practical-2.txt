    - Restriction enzymes
        - Cut DNA at specific recognition sites
        - Fragment count = recognition sites + 1
            - Ex: 5 cuts => 6 fragments
    - Ligases
        - Glue DNA
            - Must be blunt pieces with compatible ends (sticky ends)
    ? Polymerases
        - Synthesize DNA/RNA
    - Cloning Vectors
        - An autonomously replicating genetic element used to carry DNA into a
          host cell for the purpose of gene cloning
    ? Transformation
        - The genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the direct uptake and
          incorporation of exogenous genetic material from its surroundings
          through the cell membrane(s).
    ? Electrophoresis-size fractionation
        - Small molecules travel faster (further)
        - Large molecules move slower (not as far)
    - Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
        - A planar molecule that intercalates (inserts) between DNA base pairs
            - Binds between the base pairs pairs

    - Making new DNA usually involves:
        1) Cutting DNA (restriction enzyme)
        2) Pasting DNA (Ligase)
        3) Making many copies and clones (Cloning Vector)

    - Electrophoresis
        - Separation technology
        - Molecules move with electric current
        - Electrophoresis-size fractionation
            - Small molecules go fast, large molecules go slow
        - DNA is negatively charged
            - Moves from the negative side to the positive side
        - Gel Agarose
            - Provides the mesh that the DNA must travel through when pulled
              towards the positive side
        - Ladder (Standard Size)
            - Pre cut DNA with known number of base pairs per fragment that we
              can use to as a "ruler" for the DNA we are actually testing.
            - Brightest glowing pair on ladder usually is some specific size of
              base pairs (300 or 500 base pairs)
        - Lambda phage
            - We usually have one uncut lambda and then the lambda cut with the
              unknown enzymes

    - Know:
        - Chambers (L and R are swapped)
            - Top 2: Atriums
            - Bottom 2: Ventricles

        - Vessels

        - Blood Flow
            - Pulmonary Artery -> Lungs
                - Where it carries deoxygenated blood
            - Systemic -> Rest of the Body
                - Aorta
                    - Artery
                    - Systemic loop
                - Where it carries oxygenated blood
                - Must pump harder than pulmonary artery
        - Arteries
            - Coronary
                -
            - Blood travels away from the heart
        - Veins
            - Blood travels towards the heart
            - Superior Vena Cava
                - Carries deoxygenated blood to the heart from the head, arms,
                  and upper body.
            - Inferior Vena Cava
                - Carries deoxygenated blood to the heart from the legs and
                  lower body.

    - Don't need to know
        - Valves

    - Blood Flow in Humans
        1) Deoxygenated Blood (DB) arrives in the right atrium via the superior
           vena cava (from upper part of the body) and the inferior vena cava
           (from lower part of they body)
        2) The DB is pushed into the right ventricle
        3) The DB is then pushed into the pulmonary artery, which takes blood
           away from the heart and into the left and right lungs (pulmonary
           circulation)
        4) The lungs convert the DB into Oxygenated Blood (OB).
        5) The blood is then pulled into the left atrium from the left and right
           pulmonary veins (pulmonary: lungs, veins: towards the heart)
        6) The OB is pushed into the left ventricle.
        7) The OB is pushed out of the aorta (an artery) and then circulates
           throughout the upper and lower body (systemic circulation).
        8) After circulating the body, the OB blood becomes DB, and it returns
           to the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava.

    - Red:  Oxygenated
    - Blue: Deoxygenated

    ============================================================================

    - Open-Heart Systems
        1) Pumps blood out of the system via arteries
        2) Brings blood directly back into the heart through openings in it
        -  Ex:
            - Grasshoppers
    - Closed-Heart Systems (based on birds and mammals system slide)
        1) Pulmonary Circulation: Heart pumps deoxygenated blood to capillaries
           (in humans, this is in the lungs) via the arteries
        2) The capillaries return oxygenated blood to the heart via the veins.
        3) Systemic Circulation: The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood to
           the system (aorta)
        4) The system returns deoxygenated blood to the heart.

        - Blood never leaves the system like it does in an open-heart system

    - Bradycardia
        - Heart beat slows
    - Tachycardia
        - Heart beats quickly
    - Blood pressure
        - Systole (contraction) / Diastole (relaxation)

                      attached to the main portion of the plant
                    - A node is responsible for the growth contained in a bud
                    - Ex: On a potato, the "eyes" are nodes; its where the
                      sprouting begins (what is sprouting here though?)
                - Internodes

            - Vascular bundles scattered in stem
            - Leaf veins parallel
                - Ex: Corn
            - Flower parts in 3s or multiples of 3s

        - Dicot
            - Two cotyledon in seed
            - Vascular bundles in a distinct ring
            - Leaf veins form a net pattern
